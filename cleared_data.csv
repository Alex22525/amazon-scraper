,"Tanya Romanov’s book, Mother Tongue is a compelling history of one family who was tragically impacted by the sequence of events that shaped the history of the 20th century. She brings this history to life with her story.
This sequence of events begins in the former country of Yugoslavia where her family lived. On June 28th, 1914 the Austro-Hungarian Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a Bosnian nationalist, Gavrilo Princip. This assassination set off a long sequence of events including World War one, The Russian Communist Revolution, World War Two, the Cold War and the Yugoslavian Civil war of the early 1990s. Tanya Romanov’s family was directly impacted by all of these events.
Tanya’s family had lived in Istria on the east coast of the Adriatic see for four hundred years. They had originally come from Montenegro and had been lured to Istria by the prospect of employment in the ship building trade. Tanya’s grandfather, Martin, had been a ship builder.
The story starts with her grandparents, Martin and Katarina. During World War One, Katarina and her children are sent to a refugee camp in Hungary. She and two girls survived, but her two sons were taken away when they got the flu and never returned. After the war, she and her daughters returned to Istria and she and Martin have several more children, all girls. Zora, whose name means “dawn” was born in 1922.
Shortly before Zora was born, Mussolini came to power in Italy, and, as Istria had been ceded to Italy, Mussolini attempted to stamp out Slavic culture in the province. Their Serbo-Croatian language was forbidden, and people were forced to change their names to Italian names. Martin had to register his newborn daughter as Albina, the Italian word for “Dawn.” But Martin could not tolerate the oppression and he took his family to another part of Yugoslavia.
World War Two brought new hardships, and after the war Yugoslavia was ruled by Josip Broz Tito, who had led the guerrilla fighting against the Nazi and Italian invaders. Zora got a good job with the nascent telephone company, and she married a white Russian and gave birth to a son. Tito, however, had a falling out with Stalin and began rounding up Russians to send back to the Soviet Union. Zora’s husband was in danger of being sent to Russia and, as an anti-communist, might well have been executed if he had been. So shortly after Tanya’s birth the family fled to a displaced persons camp in Italy. Tanya spent her early years in this refugee camp.
After several years, the family obtained visas to immigrate to the U.S. and joined relatives in San Francisco. It is literally a rags to riches story.
Many years later, Zora and Tanya and her husband go back to Istria, seeking to connect with relatives who remained there. By this time Yugoslavia is experiencing civil war. Tito, who had held the country together, had died. The Serbs had allied with the allies during World War Two, while the Croats had allied with the Axis. Political and religious animosities tore the country apart. Istria, however, was relatively unaffected and the family were able to go there from Italy.
Mother Tongue is a fascinating memoir both on the historical and personal level.",Robin E. Levin," April 1, 2020",5.0,dp
A Fascinating Memoir,"Tania Romanov is a gifted storyteller with enough material from her own life and family history for the three memoirs she's authored so far and hopefully more to come. ""Mother Tongue"" is the first of them. The reader will learn about life in Croatia and Serbia as separate countries and as parts of a unified Yugoslavia -- an education in itself about this complicated and not well-known corner of Europe. The story then proceeds to a refugee camp in Italy, where the author spent her early childhood while awaiting permission to immigrate to the US. Next comes learning to fit into life in San Francisco while embedded in a Russian emigre community. Finally there is the fabled American success story in high tech. Her trajectory ultimately enables the author to return to her origins in the company of her mother and husband, connect with family members who had remained in the ""old country"", and make sense of the disparate places, languages and experiences which formed her into a well-integrated whole who is much more than the sum of her many parts, one who can fully and joyously relate to everyone she meets and every place she experiences. This book is a very worthwhile and enjoyable read. Highly recommended !!",Taffy Sassoon," October 16, 2020",5.0,dp
,"My maternal grandfather and I were very close ( I was the oldest of his four grandchildren). He was from Slovenia, which is north and immediately adjacent to Croatia, where this story begins. Tania has put into words about her grandmother, her mother and herself that at times are pretty emotional for me. I am in my seventies now, with my grandfather long since deceased. Obviously he isn't available to be asked questions that occur to me now that didn't when I was younger. Or I might have heard stories from him that have faded from my memory. But Tania has produced a well written memoir about her family, Slavs from Croatia almost identical to Slavs from Slovenia. Included are recollections and tidbits and anecdotes, plus similar language expressions, that jumped out at me to remind me of Grandpa or to give me insight into his Slovenian life (1901 to 1920-ish, when he came to America). This book is imminently readable, one that my wife has read and which is currently on loan to our daughter ( truth be known, my daughter's Slovenian roots come through loud and clear, even though her great-grandfather's DNA is somewhat watered down by the time it reaches her). I expect that upon the book's return to me I will want to read it again. Thanks to Tania Romanov for writing this story. I recommend it not only to the Slavic audience but to anyone who relishes a fine true story.",Fall12," December 1, 2019",5.0,dp
A rich memoir told by a gifted storyteller,"What an amazing book, writer is Tania Romanov a brilliant author, she writes about her family's story from her dad's arrival from Russia to Yugoslavia, their eventual exile from Yugoslavia to the USA, her mom's return to her home after four decades of absence. This book is a wonderful explanation of extreme complexity of people's lives on that territory.I loved book so much that I have read it two times and listened to audio version as well.",MirPeace," June 12, 2022",5.0,dp

An emotional read,"Although my mother was unable to share her family’s history in the former Yugoslavia I was able to learn so much of the country with this wonderful book. The author’s vivid and moving telling of her parents and their families’ lives within their own land provides remarkable insight into the Slavic peoples and their courage. Beautifully and lovingly written, I “armchair-traveled” with this book and I highly recommend it.",Barbara Hunt," March 12, 2022",5.0,dp
,"The real saga of a family, like so many that ends up separated in their own country. It delves into the history of the Balkans through Zola, the mother, and her daughter Tania. A family fleeing from the political chaos and persecution to the USA. They endured terrible hardships and desperation. Always conserving their language as a strong identity link to who they are. A very interesting book.",Leonor C. Gillette," July 25, 2021",5.0,dp
The most beautiful book about writer's family and their odisey,"Understanding the history of the Balkans and the ever changing landscape of those European countries during the 20th century has taken me decades. This story, spanning the lives of three generations during those tumultuous times, through two world wars and the aftermath of Soviet domination, has filled in many holes in my knowledge of those events. I knew some Balkan history from my own travels, education, close friends, and experiences living in Italy during the Cold War. And yet there was so much more to learn.

Tania’s firsthand account of her family history, coupled with her excellent research, is an unforgettable read. And a timely read. It is packed with many worthwhile themes that speak to the real values in life. Mother Tongue is more than a first language in this story. It’s also the sharing of personal family history and what the gift of passing on your heritage, however poignant, in your own words, to your children, to your family, can give them. And now Tania is sharing it with us.
It’s a must read. It will make you feel good.",Jane G," June 3, 2018",5.0,dp
,"If it were nothing else, Mother Tongue would be a poignant, dramatic memoir with an interesting language twist. But in an age when we're seeing vast populations of innocent people uprooted from their ancestral homelands by numerous political and economic imbroglios that have little to do with ordinary people, it is an incredibly timely and important book. The major takeaway for me was that anyone, ANYONE, can instantly become a refugee when inept and/or self-serving political leaders disregard the immense human capital at stake with each decision they make. Romanov describes a loving, hardworking family that has their country disappear beneath their feet and the family ripped apart...repeatedly. Despite the upheaval, the loss of loved ones, the desperation of refugee camps and struggles attempting to fit into a foreign land, love and determination prevail...for the most part. Every battle has collateral damages and Romanov's battles are no different. For me, the difficult relationship that develops over time between Romanov and her mother is the most touching and the way in which that affection, frustration, and admiration fuse makes for a very engaging story.",Keith Skinner," April 25, 2018",5.0,dp
Family first,"This book fascinated me on many levels. I was astonished at how little I knew about the history of the Balkans & was amazed at the amount of historical information I learned in reading it. It also gave me such a deeper understanding of refugees & how unbelievably disrupted their lives become in the midst of political turmoil & in many cases violence. The in depth personal level of Tania's story kept me so engaged & eager to turn the next page. What amazing ancestors Tania & her brother Sasha were ""spun"" from. Such brave & persistent parents informed their upbringing & incredible early childhood experiences that certainly informed such broad ""thinking & reaching"". America is so enriched by individuals that come with such diverse experiences, often hardships, that they turn into strengths & assets! The history of Tania Ramanov's family is both fascinating & inspiring. I highly recommend it, especially to book clubs as it is so rich with material to discuss.",Tori Louise," June 19, 2018",5.0,dp
,"Tania Romanov transports the reader to the war-torn places in the Balkans where she was born and then lived as a refugee with her family. Mother Tongue is a beautiful tribute to her mother as Tania and her husband return with Zora to her homeland on the Istrian Peninsula (Croatia) to the small village of Medulin where they search for relatives she has not seen in decades. It is a courageous journey of faith and hope. Zora is reunited with loved ones in her first homeland, but she ultimately realizes that her true homeland is America. The book is a portrait of the valiant spirit of the emigrants who left their homes and persevered as they made their way to new lands to escape the oppression and the oppressors of both World Wars. It's a must read for anyone who wants a better understanding of the refugee crisis and the immigration experience as they were and as they still exist in today's world.",Cheryl Mueller," June 19, 2018",5.0,dp
A PERSONAL PORTRAIT OF THE REFUGEE EXPERIENCE,"I very much enjoyed reading “Mother Tongue”, a well-researched, masterfully written and deeply personal story. Migrations are as old as human societies, however the massive political and economic migrations of the last 150 years are unprecedented as well as the “melting pot” nations they produced (US, Argentina and other). Tania Romanov shares with us the saga of her diverse family in search for a safe place to call home. I found it while researching my own Slavic roots and this beautiful book enlightened me on the Serbo-Croatian conflict. As all ethnic conflicts it is the product of the manipulation of two peoples that were well used to coexist and thrive side by side. Unfortunately once the genie is out the bottle it threatens the group very existence. Nobody wins.
Every immigrant and child of immigrants will find pieces of his/her own story in this wonderful book; highly recommended!",Mara G-M," June 19, 2018",5.0,dp
,"I loved this book on many levels. Tania Romanov weaves the story of three generations of her family history from Istria, Croatia to Belgrade and Novi Sad, Serbia back to Zagreb, Croatia and on to refugee status in Trieste and ultimately to San Francisco. Each of Tanya’s parents gave her the gift of their own language...her mother Croatian and her father Russian. A beautiful tale of family devotion, persistence, prejudice and heartrending choices juxtaposed against the disintegration of Yugoslavia.",jleiser," June 19, 2018",5.0,dp
"Well researched, masterfully crafted and deeply personal story","I relived my own life through Tania‘s words.

My father knew the difficulties of leaving his homeland and arriving in a new and different place, a place with a different language, culture, food and history.

His is an immigrant’s story, but Romanov’s family live through so much more. Our families are but two of the hundreds of millions of people who have these stories; however, Romanov’s comes alive in her book.

I saw an intimate portrait of three Balkan women who lived through serial relocations from country to country to arrive in places where everything was different. Through her words you will experience these separations between families as if they had happened to you.

,"I loved so much in this book. It takes us to a tiny penisula in the Adriatic that was fought over and governed by waring powers for much of the 20th century All the while we meet peasants, royalists, communists and fascists who converge in the territory now known as Former Yugoslavia. Romanov is a keen observer who understands the complexity and fragility of the people caught in the middle of opposing intrests. It is also a loving and tender tribute to her family and culture.",James Franicevich," June 19, 2018",5.0,dp
Wonderful story. Wish I had been able to give it to buddy who travelled to Croatia a few years ago.,"I was very moved by Tania Romanov's story about her family and their lives in Serbia and Croatia and experiences immigrating to America. Her family experiences explain and bring to life some of the history of the area at a very authentic, personal level. It was so heartwarming that she was able to bring her mother back to Medulin in the 90's. My family shares a history of immigration from the same area and Romanov's story helped me understand and put into context their experiences.",AIto," June 19, 2018",5.0,dp
,The author 's family story is a story of so many families. This is also a history book with the accurate events and the affect of the events on families and ordinary people.

Through the story of her family we learn of the ordeal of war-torn Balkan countries during the 20th century and today. How families coped with WWI, WWII, and the aftermath. It's a story of a family, and also expresses what it means to be ""family."" I was surprised how little I actually knew of this recent history.

,"Six months ago I found myself standing next to a stranger named Tania in a foursome at a holiday party in the crowded kitchen of a friend in San Francisco.

Tania seemed to be somewhere in my own age bracket (I am 66), and struck me as bright, spirited, funny, easy-with-a-laugh, quick-with-a-comeback—and thoroughly American. Tania did not mention it, but later someone else in the kitchen told me that Tania had an incredible life story and had written a memoir soon to be published by Travelers’ Tales. I have long considered Travelers’ Tales to be the gold standard of travel writing, but I could not have guessed how much this book would touch me. In many ways, it resembles the immigrant story of the Ruthenian side of my own family (Ruthenian culture is centered in what is now called Slovakia), and in many ways it is shorthand for the past 150 years of United States history, and, more broadly, several millennia of world history.

Many of us in the US and other parts of the planet are prone to writing off “the Balkans”, mainly because we have little understanding of their historical importance and relevance to our current global cluster-conundrum. The most common reaction to any mention of the region might be, “What ARE the damn Balkans, anyway?” Is Yugoslavia in the Balkans? Are the Balkans in Yugoslavia? Are the Balkans part of Russia? Italy? Turkey? Greece? Are the people of the Balkans predominantly Serbs or Croats or Hungarians or Macedonians or Montenegrins or Ottomans? Are they Muslim or Russian Orthodox or Greek Catholic or maybe part of the Byzantium Rites Church? How does the Austro-Hungarian Empire fit in here? Do the Balkans border the Baltic Sea? (If you’re actually wondering, the answer to that last question is No.)

By traveling from her San Francisco home to “the Balkans”, and by investigating the stories told by her “refugee/immigrant” mother plus the stories of her “Displaced Person” grandmother, Tania unravels for readers the region's tightly-knotted ethnic, religious, geo-political, and historical scenarios. (For 400 years Tania's ancestors lived in a small beautiful village on the coast of what we today call Croatia, until being forced to flee their home in the aftermath of World War I, and then to flee again during the run-up to World War II.)

Early on I found myself wondering if Tania would be able to bring everything together, would be able to bring this sprawling story “home”? By the end I was one hundred percent satisfied. Actually, I was astounded.

I’ll just stop there.

Great story. Absolutely worth the read.",Brad Newsham," March 22, 2018",5.0,dp
Left me astounded,"I read Tania Romanov's 'One Hundred Years Of Exile', which I really enjoyed, and that led me to this book. And I enjoyed this book even more than 'One Hundred Years Of Exile'. Although I have family connections back to former Yugoslavia, I would still be just as enthusiastic about this book if I knew nothing about the region. What I find so fascinating about the book is getting to read about one family's story in great detail, which helps fill in a bit of what gets lost in a regular book about history. I also really liked the family pictures included in the book, which puts faces to the names. Perhaps the best thing about the book is spelled out in the title - the relationships between the three women.",JiPo_BC," March 22, 2018",5.0,dp
,"Mother Tongue is both poignant and illuminating. It’s also incredibly timely. Whether or not it was the author’s intention, living the unbelievable trials and tribulations of three generations of Romanov’s family right along with them makes what’s happening in many places in the world today seem less abstract; it humanizes the many refugee crises with which the world continues to contend. Likewise, Romanov does a wonderful job of illustrating, through her family’s struggles, the implications of what it means to be both deeply connected to and mercilessly uprooted from a place. In the process, Romanov somehow manages to clearly articulate a very complicated and important part of the past—without it feeling as though she’s giving us a boring or endless history lesson. What's more, Romanov’s story reminds us of the promise and power of the American dream, at a time when it often almost seems forgotten. Finally, I’ll add that one of my favorite aspects of Mother Tongue was how it beautifully illustrates, repeatedly and in different ways, the importance of language—personally, politically, and otherwise—something else many of us may not have ever paused to consider. Mother Tongue is an inspiring, very worthwhile read by someone who has led a fascinating life and no doubt has many more tales to tale.",C. Byrne," March 22, 2018",5.0,dp
A fascinating personal history.,"I am a slow reader. But I finishted this book in two sittinigs, into the quiet of the night. The saga of three women in a far distant land touched my heart deepy. Theirs is a story of universal truths - the story of immigrants and refugees and their displacement by politics and war. The imposition of unreasonable government policies is not an abstract, it hurts real people, and real families.
Tania Romanov is a great story teller. She engages you slowly at first but her words quickly pick up speed and you suddently find yourself educated about the Balkans in a way you've never really understood and then, everything becomes clear. These women's lives get into your heart, and theat's where they stay. The calamities of history are cruel but no match for the human spirit and determination for survival. This is a story of triumph and a celebration of the courage that it takes to achieve it.
A wonderful book to read, learn, and enjoy. Take it with you on a trip, your time will go quickly.. And you wll feel inspired and unlifted.",Julie T," March 22, 2018",5.0,dp
,"This is a concisely written true story of three family generations in the volatile Balkans. If you will be visiting the region, as I have twice, this is a must read. Regardless, Tania's ability to hold the reader through complex generational transitions is exceptional. I read it in two days; a real page turner.

Additional review written by Lee N.:
Mother Tongue was our Northern California book group selection for April, 2018. We were glad we further explored this beautiful and world crossroads area that many of us have visited or read about before.
Tania’s creative nonfiction sparked our shared appreciation of family birth language, upheaval politics and oral traditions. The humble storytelling of her grandmother’s, mother’s and her own experiences, wishes, fears and hopes illustrated the complex history of Yugoslavia and the immigrant experience. Can you imagine having “Stateless” on your Passport Papers?
I warmly recommend attending the numerous, easily available author readings. I have enjoyed 2 and each one was unique and highly spirited.",Lee N.," March 22, 2018",5.0,dp
Poignant and illuminating tale that resonates with some realities today.,"Tania Romanov follows her close-knit family whose members lived through almost inescapable conflicts (Croatia, Serbia, and Yugoslavia, Russia, Romania, Italy, Montenegro) during the first half of the twentieth century. At first glance, it seems a short, easy read – and that it is. But tucked under the surface in every chapter there is so much cultural and historical insight. We feel disgust at politically-motivated aggression focused on helpless refugees trying to escape from unlivable situations, but Tania reminds us that nationalist leaders often play that card to rally support; in her times, it was Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Marshal Tito, Joseph Stalin, and several Balkan leaders. Her family with its Croatian, Serbian and Russian branches gives us names, faces, and victims, and a very much needed human perspective. Witness the strength of family and sibling ties, and the power that knowledge of different languages has to help one survive when survival is possible, and like Tania, blossom when given the chance.",Stephen Ayala," March 22, 2018",5.0,dp
,"Loved your book, Mother Tongue. Enthralled by it and finished it in 2 sittings. This is my mother's story. So many similarities right down to the coffee, the meals, the family names (Vjekoslav, Milan, Slavica, Katerina) fleeing from conflict and war, changing their Croatian names, marrying outside of their culture (my mother married an Armenian), Displaced Person's Camps, a refugee, sponsored to America with her 2 yr old daughter in 1949 and finally finding a new life in San Francisco. I always thought my mother's surname was changed because it is not a Croatian name (Vengar); it sounds more German even though she was born in Zagreb. I see also that you did a reading in Healdsburg, CA. I live near Santa Rosa. If you ever appear locally again, I'd love to meet you. Thank you for writing this book.

A Must Read before visiting Croatia and the Balkans,"I don't usually read memoirs, so maybe this is par for the course, but as interested as I am in the personal lens through which the author lets us view generations of Balkan history, I could barely finish the book.

Personal look at how the wars affected Yugoslavia and its people,"Tania's inviting family saga brings Balkan history alive as we learn about the lives of Tania, her mother and grandmother. As the winds of war splintered country borders, Tania and her parents fled to a refuge camp in Trieste before moving to the United States. Meanwhile, the extended family became Serbs, Croats, Macedonians and Bosnians as borders moved, and their religions became Catholic, Orthodox and Moslem. The power of the mother language is evident as Serbo-Croatian, which was shared by Tania and Zora, gave them a special connection to each other as well as providing a connection with their scattered, disparate family members.

,"Balkan means wooded Mountains in Turkish. This important book traces the historical evolution of the Balkans. A geographical region in the southeast of Europe, roughly equivalent to the area covered by Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Kosovo, Croatia, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, and sometimes Romania. This region was conquered and occupied by influential empires such as the Romans, the Byzantines, the Ottomans, the Venetians, and the Austrians. These empires viewed the Balkans as a geostrategic position that linked Europe with Asia and the Middle East.

From classical antiquity through the Middle Ages, the Balkan Mountains took the name from the local Thracian name Haemus. According to Greek mythology, the Thracian king Haemus was turned into a mountain by Zeus as a punishment, and the mountain remained with his name. A reverse name scheme has also been suggested. D. Dechev considers that Haemus (Αἷμος) is derived from a Thracian word *saimon, 'mountain ridge'. A third possibility is that ""Haemus"" (Αἵμος) derives from the Greek word ""haima"" (αἷμα), meaning 'blood.' The myth relates to a fight between Zeus and the monster/titan Typhon. Zeus injured Typhon with a thunderbolt, and Typhon's blood fell on the mountains, from which they got their name.

During the Ottoman domination, various nationalist revolutions started; the most important was the Greek Revolution of 1821. Also, in 1912-1913 the Balkan Wars involved the region in a bloody conflict and were detrimental to the Ottoman Empire. In the 1990s, the USA fought Serbian nationalism. The Balkans is a vital area for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This book gives an articulated analysis of the Balkans.

The Balkan Wars is a series of events that led to two wars, 1912 and 1913. The Ottoman Empire lost territory during this time, and Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece gained territory. During the first Balkan war, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece managed to push the Ottoman Empire east. The Great Powers (Britain, France, Germany, Austro-Hungary, and Italy) meddled in the war's end. The Great European Powers used the Balkans to benefit their own national interests. Also, the issue of Macedonia occupied the wars. Greece obtained the majority of the Macedonian territory. Macedonia since Ancient Times was Greek.",Vassilios Damiras," November 1, 2018",5.0,dp
The Balkans,"I like the series and have read a number of the offerings. they, and this example, are short but shoot for comprehensive coverage at the cost of detail, context, and compelling writing. We get what we want with ""The Balkins"". what we want is a quick look at hundreds of years of history with bits devoted to Suliman the Maginicant and Vlad the Impalier.
The utility of a work like this is that it gives one background, a foundation if you will, from which to delve more deeply into the subject. The Balkans, it is said, has an excess of history. Here we get to see some of it.

the Balkans,"This accounting of a complex area -- with a long, varied, and storied history -- is astonishingly brief.

,"In keeping with the Captivating History brand, “The Balkans” is a short, easy-to-digest history that could be read in one evening. It’s not designed to be an in-depth, academic study; rather, it’s written in an accessible style for curious readers who want to fill in a gap in their historical knowledge.

I doubt that many Americans (especially those under 50) could even point to the Balkans on a map. Part of the confusion is that the borders of this southeast corner of Europe have been redrawn many times. But even though the countries are small, they have played an outsized role in European history. Probably the most famous event was the killing of the Archduke Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist, which started the fall of dominoes that ended with World War 1. But this book goes much further than recent history, looking at the many people groups who inhabited this region: Greeks, Romans, Turks, Mongols, Slavs, etc. There are conflicts between ethnic and religious groups, and pivotal full-scale battles that changed the map of the area. Plus, there are memorable characters, including soldiers, sultans, and violent rulers like Vlad Dracul, the source of the Dracula legends.

The book covers a lot of territory, and often seems like an outline rather than a traditional history book. The writing is at average reader level, and sometimes ventures into a very casual, off-hand style. There are even a few errors, such as the substitution of “plow shears” for the word “plowshares.” The book made me want to look into certain events in more detail, and that’s one of the strong points of these short, popular histories. They are appetizers for bigger historical meals.",PianoGuyFromSC," November 1, 2018",5.0,dp

Breezy and informative,"The author of this book has an engaging writing style that propels the story along at a fast clip. Having read several tomes on the Crusades, it was interesting to read about these battles from the Balkan/Ottoman side (what was going on in the Balkans that alarmed people enough to call for help from the Western Christians). 

After the Crusades, the Ottoman Empire eyed Constantinople. Finally, in 1453, the Ottomans seized Constantinople and toppled the Byzantine Empire. At that point, the Balkans were ripe for the plucking. There is an interesting description of the Janissaries, the elite fighting force of the Turks. They were the children of subjected people trained as fierce Turkish warriors.

Religion was complex in the Balkans. For example, one of the local traditions of Hungary was the belief in vampires. The author cleverly weaves the story of Vlad II and Vlad III Dracula (Vlad the Impaler) into this story of the Balkans. It certainly keeps the discussion lively. The Blood Countess, Elizabeth Bathory, is also mentioned. Gruesome events happen when folks don't have television; they think of brutal ways to kill their enemies. Not to be outdone, the Ottoman leader, Hurshid Pasha, had a stone tower erected with fourteen rows of defeated Serbian skulls. He intended to scare the Serbs - but it didn't work.

The Ottoman's attempts to take Vienna are interesting because the reader sees it from the Ottoman perspective (instead of the usual Western Europe viewpoint). That is why I found this book to be so interesting. The stories come through from the opposite angle. Essentially, this book shows the power and gradual decline of the Ottoman Empire. The 'cage policy' of the Turkish leaders certainly explains the weakening of their leaders (Potential leaders hid away from the world; their first activities were as the leader of the country. They had little comprehension of how to rule).

My favorite quote in this book was by Tito (ruler of Yougoslavia): ""I am the leader of one country which has two alphabets, three languages, four religions, five nationalities, six republics, surrounded by seven neighbors, a country in which live eight ethnic minorities."" This quote encompasses the challenges the Balkan states grappled with since ancient times.",JJares," March 2, 2018",5.0,dp
,"The Balkans are an area that most Americans have heard about but know only snippets of its history. This book provides a long chronicle of details for a group of countries which at a macro level have great similarities, but at the local level are extremely different. These differences stem from being geographically at the junction of where Asia and Europe transition, religiously, culturally and ideologically. The area has gone back and forth and been subjected to numerous ‘wars of occupation’ starting with Alexander the Great continuing up through the Cold War. The author has provided a vast amount of background for understanding centuries old conflicts which endure through today’s times among multiple peoples. The book would benefit from a few maps to provide geographic references and context but is otherwise a superb overview of the Balkans.",CABG115," March 2, 2018",5.0,dp
"In the Balkans, you get a little bit of everything, including an appearance by Dracula.","Croats, Serbs, Bosnians, Slovenes, Bulgars, Magyars, Macedonians, Albanians, Bulgars, Slavs, Montenegrins, Romanians, Kosovos, Greeks and Turks have all played a part in the history of the Balkans. There are more ethnic groups in the Balkan region than in any other region of the world and when people of different cultures and beliefs live in close proximity there is bound to be friction. This book explains how through migration and conquest so many ethnic groups came to be located in such a small region of the world. The warlike nature of some of those who migrated from the north created conflict among those who already lived there. As a former history teacher I highly recommend this book because it explains how the violent nature of the region has affected world history. Even in the recent breakup of the Yugoslavia the multinationalis has created wars that have lasted into the 21st century which have affected the United States. This book explains the multiculturalism as it was emerging from earlier times. The Balkans have been a region occupied by empires from the beginning and only recently have achieved self government. From Roman rule through Byzantine, Ottoman empires and even rule by invading Slavics they have fought for their territory unsuccessfully. Multinational wars including world wars have ignited from this region. Learn about the troubled history of these peoples and how they have affected the world.

Without revealing all the details, readers should know much of what they could ever wonder about the Balkans in covered within these pages. Of course, it is done through the tried and true combination of meticulous research and accessibility for which this author is known.

An Exceptional Work,"The Balkan Peninsula is a fascinating and complicated region. The Balkan Peninsula once was part of the Ottoman Empire along with the Romans, Byzantines, Greeks and Persians just to name a few. All these different empires also brough different religions with them and all want the people of the Balkan Peninsula's to join their religion those who didn't were often second-rate citizens with a heavy tax burden or forced to worship secretly. Each of these empires also left lasting marks upon the region when they were replaced by the next empire.
This book also mentions a Wallachian prince by the name of Vlad who also belonged to the Order of the Dragon. We know Vlad by another name, Dracula. The book also mentions another famous lover of blood, Elizabeth Bathory. The book also covers Alexander the Great and several more famous warriors, all of which played a role in the history of the Balkan Peninsula.
Did you know the Balkans were a major factor in WWI? The assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand caused the first World War. When the Austro-Hungarians declared war everyone who had an alliance with them or with Serbia considered themselves at war also.

,"The term ""Balkanized"" is reflective of the Southeastern European countries that comprise the Balkans: Slovenia, Serbia, Romania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Moldova, Kosovo, Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Albania. These nations are the result of centuries of struggles between the Christian kingdoms of southeastern Europe and the Islamic armies that pushed through from the region now known as Turkey.

The term is also reflective of the way the Allied powers formalized the divisions after World War One. But Captivating History illuminates the fact that this region has had regular habitation since the end of the Ice Age.

,"I liked this movie. The only criticism is the actress clearly is no dancer although she plays one and they actually show her ""dancing.""

"Fun, Sweet Movie","Obvoiusly the main actor was the writer. He wasn't very good at acting. heck, he wasn't very good at writing either, as the story seems like he was telling fact, but it didn't come acros as beleivable. The back and forth between his GF and her employer made it seem like the decisions were made by high schoolers. And then, the main guy also had the same weird back and forth with his employer.

The guy's GF didn't seem to know acting well either. The characters reacted to situations like they were from another planet. My wife and I both felt the same way about the film..",EQue," September 7, 2019",5.0,dp
,"This was a simply magical indie journey through what Inunderstand to be a real life true story of two people from completely opposite worlds coming together and the roller coaster ride they share during the incredible journey. You can feel the chemistry coming through the screen. Holdridge does an incredible job as a very believable Woody Allen type of neurotic character and Linnea Sassen was beautifully innocent yet an educated presence with great responses to her counterpart... The side story features Rupert Friend and is unusually interesting . Great ending , unpredictable and a fun watch!",Julie L.," January 27, 2017",5.0,dp
Not believable or interesting,"Very good film. I saw this in Los Angeles at the movie theater. The romantic relationship between Alex Holdridge and Linnea Saasen is great, they later married in real life. Rupert Friend plays the best friend and Jason Ritter makes an appearance in the film.

Fantastic Pictures,"This is not one of my favorite NGS books, but it will be for many readers. I prefer the books that are comprised of out-of-this-world photographs. This book is a guide for would-be tourists. The book opens with a double-page spread of a world map with the destinations shown in the book marked on the map by category. It's perfect for people who have seen pictures of exotic locales who have the time and money to go visit those quaint locations. Each location has descriptive text and a few outstanding NGS photographs taken at each of those locations. This book will a must for many tourists. It's kind of nice having the geographical locations pointed out in one coffee table book. Its the kind of book that will be accompanied by a tourists handbook of places to see, stay and eat. I still have my ancient, dogeared copy of ""Europe on $5 A Day."" It was a perfect travel guide for its era. I actually spent six weeks traveling around Europe for under $5 per day. Of course, that price really didn't include airline fares and required a Euro-Train Pass and many nights sleeping on bunk beds or cots in dormitories in hostiles.
This book does include a NGS photograph of the most famous sites in the 225 locations described and shown. That will keep the tourist from missing the main attraction of that piece of world geography.",James R. Holland," November 8, 2015",5.0,dp

Knowing that he's largely a nature photographer, it felt right to get him a National Geographic book! There were some other books that sounded great and probably have nice photos, but looking at the reviews the people who bought it had issues with the photo size being too small. I really didn't want to gift my dad a book with tiny nature photographs. So, I was a tad worried even though I didn't see any comments like that for this book. Thankfully, the photos were wonderful and a great size/quality! He really enjoyed it and had a great time flipping through the NatGeo photos from around the world.

If you're a well traveled person, this may not have so much to offer. I found I had been to several of the featured destinations. However, there were still some neat spots I hadn't even heard of!

I expected the destinations to be all exotic and quite frankly out of an average traveler's price range, however there was a healthy balance between far away, exotic places and more closer (to North America at least) and affordable options. There are not a lot of destinations in the southern hemisphere and Cape Town did not make the cut (which I thought would definitely be on the list). Overall the photographs are National Geographic standard which means it makes a beautiful book to look at even if you never travel to these destinations.

A great place, with stunning views, to eat and stay over while hiking around the Swiss Alps. Could be a day trip, or a stopover as part of a longer hike.

However,the book gets two stars as it doesnt show any thing about Samarkand or anything related to that part of the world in Asia and the beautiful 'man-made' architecture in this book. I was expecting more actually. Most of the places mentioned in the book are well known actually and advertised on regular basis on TV and online. What made me doubt the book is including Qatar as place to visit in the Hand of Man chapter! Qatar is like any gulf country which basically takes its fame from soaring modern architecture. I also think it's geared to show readers certain places in mind,as if gearing readers to only Europe and the Americas and specific locations in the other continents.

Useful For Budget Conscious Travel,"I wasn't super educated about Serbia and Montenegro, but was looking for some family and budget-friendly locales and ended up coming across this. This is a really great way to introduce you to what is a pretty facisnating culture, and the best part about it for me that it is designed for people who seek to be thrifty. Most travelers avoid locations that aren't trendy, which means you end up spending a lot on overpriced tourist attractions. Serbia and Montenegro is actually quite beautiful and with a rich history, and this book both educates you on the sights and sounds while also providing practical travel information like expected budget and required documentation.

I never really imagined that this was a locale for me, but when you research the tourist friendly areas you realize you get a bang for your buck, especially for a family, that really does stand out when compared to other tourist destinations. The book shows you the many options you have throughout the year, so you can even find things for both couples and kids during what is normally the offseason for tourism. For someone who never really thought I'd consider this as a desitnation, this book actually does a pretty good job at outlining both the pros and potential cons, and now Serbia and Monetengro is def on my list when it comes to potential travel spots.",May," November 7, 2015",1.0,dp
,"Systematic is what I’ll use to describe the author. And also very detailed, it is not a matter of just traveling to Serbia or Montenegro and back, it is about how to plan your trip in a way that you’ll enjoy and hope to come back for the same enjoyment or for more. The author started from the basics, you already know and want to travel to Serbia and Montenegro, what are you required to do? The most important thing is to identify yourself, to enter the country legally, that’s what the author started with. Yes, of course there is history about Serbia but that was to ensure you are right about what you already know.
The author also added more information about accommodations, transport, outfit, medication, transportation, language. It is very nice to know such information because they make you ready to go. Not forgetting, the book is current so even covid measures are discussed in full. Like once you read this book you’re ready to explore.
What if you’re new to this information or Serbia but you’d like to explore, the author was kind enough to put down places and events that are interesting to visit. Like before even you travel, you should already know where you want to visit and already know what your budget can afford. Best tourist attractions are highlighted and explained on what is expected and also links outside the book are provided for more reading and understanding on the same.
There are several cities in Serbia and trust me, every city is well explained with different destinations that can be toured, addresses, phone numbers, time to visit, how to get there, so to the point, like the information is good.
Montenegro is another country with great places to visit and great adventures, all you need to know about those two countries relating to tourism and adventure, you’re at the right place, here in this book. For me let me buckle up and be ready for my adventure. I already am in love with this countries!!",Chichi," January 6, 2016",1.0,dp
Easy way to enjoying vacation in Serbia and Montenegro,"Wow, I am planning to travel to Croatia for my short holiday as I normally do every year and I needed some information about the country and what I should carry along with me so that I can get the full satisfaction on this trip. This book really gave me more than I wanted. I am sorry but I will have to write a long review for this because I have a lot to say after reading this book.

I never knew Croatia was among the Balkan States which comprises Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Slovenia, Kosovo, Romania, and my darling Croatia I intend to visit.

This book did not just provide me insights into the Historical parts of each country specifically, it also gave me a roadmap, guidelines, and what to expect. It didn't just end there, the book gave me an in-depth weather forecast, how to dress when I am in each country (if I decide to tour around the countries), what to put in my traveling luggage, the kind of healthcare available, oh, I can go on and on.

From the author's write-up, you could see He has passion as He took his time which each country's description based on first-hand experience. This is a great book to buy and if you are planning on traveling to any of the Balkan countries, you will be doing yourself great displeasure not getting a copy of this book.

Having said that, I think I want to go read this book again.",Ginny," February 18, 2016",1.0,dp
,"I have been planning a trip to Croatia ever since Game of Thrones shot some scenes there. I have been reading a lot about the history of the area and came across this book. I realized this is exactly what I had to read and understand. This guide gives you a complete outline of the language, and common terms you will need to talk to the locals. Speed limits. The last thing we want is to be in trouble with fines when we hire our vehicle and travel, so understanding the speeds was also a great addition. I enjoyed looking at the pictures of the beaches and the clear water. I have already looked up some of the accommodation options offered in the book, that I would not have known to look for, so thank you! You have saved me a lot of money on booking fees!

Overall I give this book a solid 5 for its tips and tricks. If you are looking to travel to this area don't go past this book. I think, some of the information in here will also be valuable for other regions, it's the questions you DON'T ask yourself while planning holidays that are best explained here!

A Guide To Travelling Balkan Countries,"This is a great travel book/guide. The book is neatly divided into two sections. You guessed it: Serbia and Montenegro. Each section has details ranging from cost to stay at a hotel to the best places to visit. Apparently Serbia has a ""Ball cooking festival"". Make sure you pack enough of them when you visit :). I love how the author goes into great details about the all aspects of travel-- clothing, shoes, culture, etc. I also love the pictures in the beginning of each chapter.

Informative - Easy to follow,Quite disappointed in content and the writing. It doesn’t seem to have been edited for typos: there are many sentence fragments and repeated phrases throughout.

A great coffee table book and a travel guide,I found the book to be very interesting. The author made a real effort to go into detail of the culture and what to expect on visiting Serbia and Montenegro. What I think is most interesting about this book is that it reflects on a very current time which is the Pandemic that we are currently in. It talks about covid and what to expect and the procedures to take while in the country.

Travelbug inspo at its finest,"Everyone has a different style when it comes to travel. Still, people tend to have a budget, along with at least a few reasons to be thrifty. This is a detailed and informative guide that can help you accomplish that balance while enjoying a trip to Croatia.

Who better to learn about a place from, than a proud and loyal resident? Connecting with locals can be one of the most enriching elements of traveling. The knowledge of a native is truly incomparable. When coupled with their genuine passion and pride in their home, it creates a heartfelt testament that speaks volumes.

Once someone has their heart set on a place to visit, figuring out the details is a must. Travel and lodging, getting around, what to do and see, etc., are important parts of planning any trip. Knowing ahead of time what each region of Croatia has to offer is critical in deciding how to distribute the time there. Awareness of the currency, the health care system, safety and emergency information, even useful apps, are imperative, and all at your fingertips with this clear, easy read. Useful phrases, along with tips for navigating the nightlife, cuisine, coastline, castles, and much more, are all laid out in an approachable format by an expert.

Everything is well illustrated in the entire book including the history of the Country. This will even give you some hopes of visiting the Country even if it was not in your mind. The book lets you have a planned budget and while in the Country, you won’t face some financial challenges because you already have the full information.

,"I love this book on the the various Santeria potions, spells and rituals. once you get past some of the outlandish ingredients such as monkey feces, walk by a cemetery at 12:00 PM where two dogs fought huh? powered human skull and powered African frog. *roll eyes* now while Palo is a path of black magik and does contain some diabolical rituals and ingredients we are not in the Congo. true practitioners of these path's, will never reveal their secrets as they are bound by oaths of secrecy. meanwhile these other ""various"" practitioners have to write diabolical rituals so the masses can feel like they are attempting dastardly deeds, which by the way does exist. but the average person does not need to go through such lengths to obtain the benefits of magik. most magik is designed to improve every day lives, and this is where this comes in, no matter what your path, there is a ritual in here for you, there is excellent info on the various herbs for various Orisha's, formulary to make your own oils for various deities and astral energies, making candles, tinctures, incense, floor washes, bath crystals and oil lamps. its a virtual go to book on how to do ritualistic magik. once you scroll past the monkey paw, rhino's leg and tiger teeth your fine. and excellent formulary and spellbook for those wanting to delve magikal (ATR) afrikan traditional paths.",carmen sofia godinho," August 18, 2016",4.0,dp

It will not overpower you with the sense that you can't try any Santeria unless you are an initiate, the opposite it inspires you to use the spells in this book. Really it's not a beginners book and you will have to google-translate some of the herbs and depending on where you live some woods/herbs will be unavaliable but adding it to Hoodoo you can search the energy needed in a local wood or plant.

If you are going, I would strongly suggest you avoid Podgorica and Budva. Re Podgorica, what can you say about a town where three of the top ten tourist attractions are a strip mall, an office park, and a revolving restaurant?

,"For a country that is roughly the size of Connecticut, Montenegro has a ton of things going for it. This Lonely Planet guide covers much of the beauty and adventure that Montenegro has to offer in a concise pocket guide format. I used much of the advice provided by this guide for planning a trip to Montenegro, and the recommendations of the book are very helpful. However, more detail could also be provided. Many of the places are only given a brief summary or overview and do not go into the level of detail I would expect from Lonely Planet, especially for the price. Overall though this is a good guide that provides good tips and practical info for visiting Montenegro.

Also if you are going to Montenegro, definitely check out Rijeka Crnojevica and Lake Skadar. It only gets a brief mention in the guide, but this was one of the highlights of our trip!",ClariT," September 20, 2022",4.0,dp
Five Stars,"I find I rarely end up reading all the verbose text on a place. They have such few roads in montenegro that you can literally navigate around the country with the small simplistic map provided though.

I found a few of the places were hyped up far more than their actual worth though. For example the monastery which is singularly unimpressive apart from imagining having to get up that mountain without a motorised vehicle. Unless you are fervently catholic and like looking at very unattractive Russians all kissing the same place on a picture of Mary, or ducking into a tiny stinking cave-like room with a dried out corpse of a saint and kissing some priests with weird vibes then avoid. Or that large lake that you can't get too because of miles of reeds, with a tiny village next to it with rip-off boat tours and bad restaurants, a pervasive smell of swamp and a feeling of stagnant depression then avoid that too. However don't let that put you off Montenegro, you have places like Kotor bay and the national park in the north and lots more.

The food is not amazing but we had a few good meals - one very memorable place is in this book at that town in Kotor bay, inside the old town that specialise in fish, by the walls with a view of the walls climbing up the mountain - whatever it is called it is worth a visit. We developed ""The Squid Test"" since squid is so popular there we checked the price in each restaurant to gauge their prices overall. I recommend eating lots of squid there, it was quite a safe option.

See I would be better at writing this stuff, a paragraph for each place, lots of pictures, and a map :)",JS," September 20, 2022",4.0,dp
,"This book was very helpful in our 2 week stay in Petrovac, as we like to see other places too. We agree with the list of 'must see' places. This version was published in June 2013 so I did not give 5 stars as one or two things had not been updated. We were there for Petrovac night which was the Friday night - the Saturday was very quiet all day and evening, although the book states that it goes on for 2 nights. It would also be worth noting that all the young people in Montenegro come on the Friday, and there are cars everywhere - even parked on hatchings in the middle of roads, so get there early if you are going. Lucice beach was not quieter, just as packed as the town. There is also a lovely walk in the opposite direction along the cliff tops (tarmac path) which was our favourite, and, if you have a good torch, there are dark, long tunnels that people use to get to the beach at Perezica Do, these are not mentioned. It was very helpful on our trips to Kotor, Cetinje, Lovcen and Durmitor, and we saw a lot more than would have been possible without it. Defintely worth buying.",Stuart Jamieson," September 20, 2022",4.0,dp
Decent Guide,"When I first purchased this guide and it was delivered, I was amazed and slightly worried about how sparse it was for a whole country. These guides are usually pretty comprehensive. But as I travelled around Montenegro, I slowly realised that there wasn't a lot more that could be written about what to do/see in the country as it is so new to tourism and options are limited. That said, it is very light on content. Montenegro is so beautiful but you need to make your own adventure and not go if you want to party, unless you like eurotrash music and like getting really tarted up! It would have been useful to have more information on particular towns though and places to eat, accommodation etc, as this was all lacking. I also don't feel it gave that accurate a picture of places in its various descriptions and sometimes felt like I was in a different country to the one being described.",Amazon Customer," September 20, 2022",4.0,dp
,"Montenegro is a very mountainous country with towns and villages isolated by large mountains. The interest in the place is largely in its history and isolation.. The towns are mainly confined to a coastal strip and large scale tourist developments makes keeping a guide up to date difficult. There is a danger that the coast will develop in the same way as the Spanish Costas and the past will be lost.

Que muchas personas conozcas de este buen libro,"Giovanna Montenegro's ""German Conquistadors in Venezuela: The Welsers' Colony, Racialized Capitalism, and Cultural Memory"" is a truly groundbreaking and captivating work that invites readers to explore a largely untold chapter of colonial history. Montenegro's meticulous research, eloquent prose, and interdisciplinary approach illuminate the complex dynamics at play in the Welsers' colony and its lasting impact on the region.

This extraordinary book masterfully unravels the intricate financial, political, and social factors that shaped the Welsers' colonial enterprise, while also highlighting the broader implications of racialized capitalism and cultural memory in the context of the colonial experience. Montenegro's work is a testament to her dedication to unearthing hidden histories and giving voice to the silenced narratives of the past.

""German Conquistadors in Venezuela"" is a must-read for scholars and enthusiasts of colonial history, Latin American studies, and cultural memory. Montenegro's engaging writing style and keen analytical insights make this book an essential addition to the study of the early modern colonial world.",Maria Garcia Bonini," April 22, 2022",5.0,dp

,"I love how we finally have James’ side. There were so many times while reading the other series I wondered what the heck James was doing and thinking and now we finally know. Ivy Smoak does a great job of giving the reader James’ background, his battles, and mindset.

Can’t wait for the second book to see how far his ex wife will go to make his life miserable. What a piece of work! We also get plenty of steam between him and Penny. Would have liked to have him as a professor lol. Great addition to the universe Ivy has created for her characters.",Kindle Customer," March 6, 2022",5.0,dp
POV from the Professor,"Trigger Warnings: This book revolves around a student/teacher relationship (college age, over the age of consent)

I’ve never read Ivy Smoak before and after reading this book I don’t know what that was and I am super upset I did not discover her books sooner. According to her website, this is the true first book in The Hunted Series (which I found out today will have a 5th book between Devotion and The Light to My Darkness and I am UNWELL at the moment) and is told exclusively from James Hunter’s POV. Spoiler Alert Ahead: James is a professor at the University of New Castle looking for a fresh start after leaving everything behind in New York City. On the first day of classes he quite literally runs into Penny Taylor as she is leaving the coffee shop. Thinking it is a one off and he will never see this beautiful girl again, he continues on with his day until he discovers that she is in his COMM class. This does not help James at all as he wants her but can’t have her. Enter a series of will they won’t they situations- James giving Penny his cell phone number, James walking Penny home while she is drunk, James picking Penny home after a disastrous double date. There is only one kiss during this whole will they won’t they period but let me tell you- that one kiss was all I needed to know that when they finally get together- and they finally do- would he HOT. James finally gives in thinking that he can get Penny out of his system if he just has her once and boy is he wrong! Once he gets a taste he can’t get enough. The only problem is that the more they are together, the more that Penny wants to know about James and James is afraid that if she knows the true him, she is going to run for the hills, because she is too perfect to be stuck with him. The only problem is- she is keeping secrets too. What ensues is a back and forth of are they/aren’t they. This book has a lot of back and forth in their relationship, but I could not put it down! I really was rooting for a happy ending because near the end everything blows up but was left with a cliffhanger and immediately had to get the next book because I needed to know what happened. Ivy Smoak really brought a fun read to the table with well developed, multi layer characters that kept you wanting more. Also, the spice is out of this world, which is just an added bonus in my opinion.",Shaez," March 6, 2022",5.0,dp

Love it,"I had seen this book recommended so many times, and then it was banned on Amazon and subsequently put back on the shelf that I decided I should read. It is also my first time reading Ivy Smoak's work.

Obsessed is written from Professor James Hunter's point of view. I learned at the end that there is also Penny's POV. I will take a read of those soon too.

James has moved to a new city and is now a Professor. He keeps telling himself that he is bad and does not deserve any love or unknown persons. However, Penny falls into his hands, and he has to rethink his stance on new people. Penny is all James can think about, making him seem, as the title states, Obsessed. But I can't say he is obsessed wrongly; it makes him seem real.

,"Ok I’m gonna be honest. I only read this book because a friend posted how good it was and I figured I’d give it a shot.
I honestly wanted to give this book a 3 star rating, but I decided to give it 4 stars because I did enjoy the romance scenes. But had I only rated the book on the writing I would have given it only 3 stars.

So the romance scenes are very hot and well written which was enjoyable. But the rest of the book played out just like every other romance book on the market right now. Hot billionaire meets sexy young girl and falls in love. So while I did read the whole thing and it leaves you on a cliff hangar.

Decent Read,"The Hunted series is what made me fall in love with Ivy Smoak, and her work. I had read a book previously by her several years ago, and I enjoyed it, but it led me to forgetting about her. Ever since I read the Hunted Series, I haven’t been able to put her work down, so imagine my delight when I found out she was writing Temptation from James Point of view. I have always been a huge fan of reading a book from different perspectives. I am one who believes there is always two sides to every story, and I feel in order to be able to truly understand a book you need both sides.

I thought I loved James Hunter before but seeing things from his point of view made me fall in love with him even more. With Obsessed you get to delve deeper into James struggles, and overall, it helps you understand James even more. I especially loved his inner turmoil as he juggled dating a student. This book does end with a mild cliffhanger (can we call it a cliff hanger when we know how the story ends?) and as usual I am wanting the next book now. This book had me feeling all the emotions, including the hatred I always have felt for Isabella. I loved the reference that Obsessed made to the event that happened in Empire High Betrayal and made me wonder even more how James handled it in his later years. This book was everything I didn’t know I needed, and reminded me why James should be my favorite.

With every book Ivy writes, her writing gets better and better. She just has this way of drawing you into the world that she builds, and makes you feel like these characters are real life people.

,"I came across an ad for Obsessed as I was scrolling through Facebook one day and thought it sounded interesting. Interesting was definitely a good word for the book. I felt like the book started off pretty good but I started getting slightly annoyed. Professor James Hunter is definitely OBSESSED with Penny Taylor. Lol. I honestly got tired of reading Penny Penny Penny.. he seemed to consume himself with her. Lol Kinda got a little creepy and made me wonder if he did the same to other women in his “dark past” he keeps mentioning. I also haven’t read a series in a while that is focused on one set couple so I felt like the book dragged on, not really getting anywhere but the author is just setting the tone for the series..the couple will have more books so why rush the story!The book was still a good book considering, I have already downloaded the second book that seems to be in Penny’s POV with the First being in his. I almost skipped it because I didn’t really want to redo the story, I want to know what “the devil” did to him! Lol but I don’t want to read out of line. I will say… there are plenty of steamy parts in the book. (: If you are looking for steamy, this is the one for you.

,"I have loved James Hunter throughout the entire Hunted/ LTMD series. The journey he and Penny take is amazing, but I have always wanted to know what James was thinking! I have been spoiled in other books that switch between POVs so I don't have to wonder what everyone is thinking. So I was very excited when I found out we would get book 1 from his POV.

I feel like we know James even better from EH books and already having read the Hunted/LTMD from Penny's POV. There is no ignoring how much James fights his attraction to Penny in the beginning. But it wasn’t just because of her being a student, but also his feelings of not being good enough, of being damaged, etc. Then when you get to the end of book 1 and get his full reaction to her true age - it was even more heartbreaking from his POV because he wasn't angry like I thought he was when I first read that section of Temptation. Instead you find out how utterly heartbroken he is and torn because he truly wants her to find someone her own age and better for her until he realizes what he actually must do.

Now the cliffhanger… I was not prepared to have to wait haha but it will be worth it! I really didn't think you could write a cliffhanger when I already know how the series ends up but NOOOOO leave it to Ivy for keeping us on our toes ;) Sincerely hope over time we will get to see the rest of the series from James' POV!!!",Eswartz," March 6, 2022",5.0,dp

,"This is my first jump into the Hunted Series by Ivy Smoak. I very much enjoyed reading about Penny and Professor James Hunter. I haven’t had the chance to read the series from Penny’s POV but now I think my goal will be to read it along with the releases from Professor Hunters POV.

Penny is a timid student, James is her professor in was is normally a senior level class. James has a past full of baggage and we have yet to touch the bulk of it. I can’t wait to be able to see it all, from both sides.

Both are crazy about each other with tension that breaks relatively early on! Chapter 17 anyone 🥵??? For being a couple who should keep their relationship a secret, they sure do like some very public romps. It honestly makes it all a little steamier 🔥

My one downfall is the immaturity level of Penny and James towards the end. Both made mistakes of lying by omission, and even if both were lying they were pissed at each other. Ultimately the way they handle things shows that age maybe is not just a number…. Or is it? Guess I’ll continue on when the next book of Professor Hunters POV releases!!!

,"First, I absolutely loved this book! Second, if you haven’t read the Hunted series, you will want to. Third, read Empire High while your at it. Then come back and check out Obsessed.

When I read the Hunted series I always wanted to know more about James and his past. This book made everything I questioned from him come into focus. We see the true struggle that he faced when he first went to Delaware. I truly enjoyed this book knowing what was to come but having a new perspective. James’ view of Penny and how hard he fought his taboo feelings were on point and you never question his motives.

The story begins with the coffeehouse collision and follows through the events of Temptation. Two characters I really enjoyed seeing was Dr. Clark and Ellen. I loved Ellen from before but seeing her as a mother figure to James made me cry.

There are some steamy 🔥🔥🔥 scenes and they did not disappoint!!!

Amazing,"Well first of all I want to mention that the hunted series is my all time favorite series ever! I have read some other stories where they give the male point of view and while they were good they were usually not great. I really wasn’t sure if Ivy could pull off a book as good as the first one. You know how with movies, the first one is always the best and the sequels are just ok? Well, I shouldn’t have doubted Ivy at all, because she really did it! I think I liked James point of view in “Obsessed” almost as much as Penny’s POV. It really gives you insight to how tortured James’ soul really was! I also absolutely love how Ivy pulls little sayings or events from her other books to tie them all together! If you haven’t read Temptation yet, I suggest you read that first. It’s not necessary but I feel it will give you a better understanding on where Obsession comes from. Cannot express the awe and excitement Ivy gives me as an author!

,"I took my time reading James' point of view. I didn't want to rush through it. I wanted to savor every word. The way James describes the relationship with Penny drew me in.

Everyone is talking about chapter 17. WOW! The scene is steamy and you can't help but think that Penny and James belong together. They end up having a fight and James pushes Penny away. I for one can't wait for the next book to see how James reacts, and what is going through his mind as he tries to win Penny back.

I also can't wait to find out what Isabella has done to try to keep James tied to her. She is James' wife and he's trying to divorce her.

A book from James' pov,OK I’ll start by saying I had no idea this was previously a series from Penny‘s perspective I was going into this book completely blind. With that said I’m very glad I did because I feel like I would not have enjoyed the first book from Penny‘s perspective I really felt she was naïve innocent insecure she had a lot of growing up to do. Now James I liked getting inside of his head looking at his demons with him the struggle he had. With all that said it was an OK book I went in thinking it was a professor student but not realizing it’s a huge series probably won’t finish them didn’t really care much about the story I felt like it was just all smart he kept telling us he loved her but it wasn’t feeling the love I was just being told about the love and then all the smut. And I feel like I can already guess the baseline of who the bad person is what they actually did how bad they actually are I will not be reading on at least not from Penny‘s perspective I might try again once his second book comes out we’ll see.,Reed," December 20, 2021",5.0,dp

Liked that James is shocked and extremely heady that Penny's not hesitate to be wildly uninhabited with sex with him.
Loved how James is trying to protect her from himself.
Loved how jealous he gets over Tyler

,"Loved the original from Penny’s perspective, Giving James his voice was everything! While James isn’t my favorite from this world, I do still love him. I wish though that we could have gotten a big, meaty book containing his version up until after the wedding, I hated how it just ended again, and since it’s an exact retelling, just from his view point, it felt a little overdrawn to end it so abruptly. Overall, I won’t re-read but I’m glad that I read it and added it to the long list of reasons I will always read everything that Ivy writes.",amanda mayer," June 15, 2021",5.0,dp
Obsessed is Right!!!,"This is somewhat enjoyable if you read the first installment from Penny's POV. If I were to read this without knowing anything on the series it would be very empty and hard to follow I think. I feel as though this was written assuming you read the original series first. Professor Hunter's pov is pretty tame and boring imo. A lot more drama happened on Penny's side. DNF because I remembered everything from the first 3 books of the hunted series (I was unaware it kept going past that, beating a dead horse and all that to keep the plot going I guess). This pov didn't add anything more to the story. Ivy Smoak is a good author, I just think it's time to move on from this series.",CE Griffin," June 15, 2021",5.0,dp

4 stars,"The beginning of this book almost made me DNF but I’ve read many of this author’s books and know she’s a good writer, so I continued.
The writing style is very different than most of her books. It’s all told from Prof Hunter’s POV, which has a “Dexter” feel to it. Because of this there’s a lot of monologue.
I wasn’t expecting it to end on a dramatic cliff hanger but it did. I’m attached to the characters now so waiting to read the next book will be painful.",Alyssa Arnett," June 15, 2021",5.0,dp
,"When I realized I was 90% done with the book and I still had so many questions, I got SO SAD. There are so many new little mysteries about James to unravel. I just discovered the Hunted series last month thanks to FitTeacherRachel and binged it over a weekend. I had just started on the next stories after James and Penny when I realized Obsessed would be out soon. I am just hoping I won’t need to wait too long to find out what’s next in James’ story - the cliffhanger at the end had me desperate for more! The storytelling from his POV was so well done and you won’t want to put this book down. Thank you so much Ivy for giving us more from these characters!",Jules Barker," June 15, 2021",5.0,dp
Ivy did it again!,"I was nervous for this book. The opportunity for it to be boring was very likely because it's the same story just being told differently but honestly I love it when I am wrong. Ivy did a fantastic job giving us the taste of temptation while making it a completely new book. I don't think anyone truly understands how much pain James is in until now. His heart bleeds in this book. I also love how Ivy gave James a tone completely different from Penny making his character really come to life in his own way. Well done Ivy this book is fantastic.
On a side note there has never been a character I have hated more than Isabella she freaking sucks.
I highly recommend this book to everyone!",CYERRA ♥️," June 15, 2021",5.0,dp
,When you think you have had enough of James and Penny….you just haven’t read this book yet. It was so exciting to read from James’ point of view and see his character development as he falls into a forbidden romance he tries so hard to resist. To see the internal struggles he faced really gives the reader a whole new perspective of him and makes you love him even more than you thought you did from the Hunted series (go read it if you haven’t!!!). I can’t believe Ivy pulled off one of her signature cliffhangers on a story that we all already know the ending too. James’ ex couldn’t be more of a psycho.

,"That cliffhanger omg. But man. This book was fire. Between all the steamy scenes and ""banter"" I don't know which was hotter. It's really spectacular being able to see James POV for once and to see how he feels about everything. We know what he has said to Penny but not the reasoning behind it. BREATHE. all those were probably my favorite tbh. I also loved how he tried to be good but wanted to be bad all at the same time. We all know Professor Hunter is bad influence but in a oh so good way. 😉

Temptation from James’ POV!,"This book turned out to be everything I hoped it would be, and so much more.

I really didn’t think it would be possible to expand and entertain an entirely different aspect of two characters we all know and love so well, but this is absolute perfection.

And in true Ivy style, a cliffhanger (one that we all knew was going to happen based off what happened in Temptation) still had me screaming as I turned the last page. A new twist on information we already knew.

,"As far as the actual spells and baths are concerned, they all seem fine, the information all looks sound enough. What's annoying about this book though, is that even though it's written in English, they often (but, even more annoyingly, not always) fail to translate the names of the ingredients to English. So, some spells request ""Agua de Florida"" while others want ""Florida Water"" with no consistency, and even common plants like rosemary and mint are usually referred to by their Spanish names. It just seems sensible that if the book is in English, it ought to use the common English words for the ingredients. There are also some spelling and formatting errors throughout the text, in addition.
After having the book for several years, though I've not tried anywhere near all of them, I've been happy with the results of the ones I was able to find the ingredients for (they don't seem to do well if you have to substitute ingredients, though.)

Great Baths,"I tried these baths. They work! One reviewer said they are wiccan and not santeria. So what! Ashe is ashe. The power of herbs don't increase or decrease based on the name of a system. God given herbs existed long before man made systems.

,"I am not one of Carlos Montenegro, and as we say in Spanish. ""He is not a Saint of my Devotion."" But I have to say that this little booklet impressed me. Okay the baths are a bit elaborate; the book has a cookbook feel to it. But the herbs where accurate, and to what Orisha ruled them as well. The only problem is that, if you do not know what these herbs are, you are going to be lost. As only the Spanish name is given, there is no English or Latin translation.
To make this a really complete Herbal Bath of Santeria, there should have been a section on how to properly prepare the baths, these are not proper. In dealing with herbs, Orisha practitioners know that praise and songs are given to Osain for hemust be always be petitioned, and this is a ritual in itself. Also there are certain ways in handling the herbs to get the proper Ashe' out of them, this is not discussed.
If you want to learn how to prepare herbal baths in the Santeria tradition, I would recommend you just watch your godparents. If you do not have godparents and fear the over charge in prices that most ""Botanica owner charge, who are not really initiated into Santeria"" charge. Trust me there are allot of charlatans, and I agree with the previous review. I would rather recommend the books Spiritual Cleansing: Handbook of Psychic Protection and Original Publication's Complete Book of Baths, by Robert Laremy. These books are not Orisha or Santeria, per say they are more Brujeria, but well worth the read. But these books can never make you an expert in Spiritual Healing, as these lessons are best learned with first hand experience. A book can never replace a well knowledge teacher.

,"With His Own POV Sixteen Years After Brooklyn’s Death. Matt – The Only Remaining Untouchable Bachelor – Gets Help From Penny, Who Hopes To Play Matchmaker. Be Prepared For A Few Big Surprises.

Empire High Matchmaker is the emotional fourth book in the Empire High series. The first three books in the series take place while the Untouchables are in high school, and book three’s ending is devastating. The series is Matt’s story, but it has been almost entirely told from Brooklyn’s POV to this point. This book picks sixteen years later in Matt’s POV.

Chronologically, the characters in Empire High have gone on to other series in the interim, prior to the time Empire High’s book four takes place. Keeping with the basics, though, the following books take place and advance the overall story following book three of this series:

1. Temptation (James Hunter & Penny Taylor’s story, part 1)
2. Addiction (James Hunter & Penny Taylor’s story, part 2)
3. City of Sin (Mason Caldwell & Bridget Cowen’s story)
4. Eruption (James Hunter & Penny Taylor’s story, part 3)
5. Third Chances (Rob Hunter & Daphne Hughes’s story)
6. Devotion (James Hunter & Penny Taylor’s story, part 4)
7. Missing Pieces (Tyler Stevens & Hailey Shaw’s story)
8. The Light to my Darkness (James & Penny Hunter, part 1)
9. A Whirlwind of Color (James & Penny Hunter, part 2)
10. This Is Love (James & Penny Hunter, part 3)

As you can see, a lot has happened in the lives of the Untouchables during the sixteen year interval. James Hunter has an epic romance with Penny Taylor; Rob and Mason find love as well. Matt is the only remaining bachelor of the Hunter and Caldwell brothers. You will get the most of this and all of the above books by reading them all, but it is certainly possible to skip straight to Empire High Matchmaker.

FROM EMPIRE HIGH MATCHMAKER, BOOK FOUR:

This book opens sixteen years later in the fall.

Matthew Caldwell, thirty-two, has to keep busy. Like the other Untouchables, after graduating from Empire High he went on to attend Harvard where he studied finance. He took over for his father as CEO of MAC International, a job that had originally been intended for his older brother Mason. He enjoys throwing himself into his work. In his off hours he works out, improves him home, and for the last several years he has been the volunteer assistant football coach at Empire High. With Coach Carter’s retirement, Matthew has now taken over as head coach. Empire has a winning team under his direction, and the pressure is on to score points. Still, Matt takes a stand this year when he takes Henry Jefferson under his wing. Jefferson is the only freshman on the varsity team, and it isn’t clear why Matt keeps him on as their kicker. The kid always misses. But Matt has a soft spot for Jefferson because he is a scholarship kid, like Brooklyn had been. Matt hopes that by making him into a winner, the other kids at school will embrace him.

When he goes home at the end of the day, Matt works on improving his house. The problem is that he is almost done and it is a perfect home for a family. He had dreamed of having that one day with Brooklyn. Matt made a promise to her that he intends to keep, and in keeping his commitment to her, a wife and family will never be in the cards for him. He never invites anyone to his home, where he keeps a room devoted to Brooklyn’s memory. He hangs out with Mason, James, and his best friend Rob, but there has been a lot of change in recent years. They have all found a happy ending, something that was taken from him. It is a bitter pill to swallow at times. He hates being the third wheel, but he loves all his nieces and nephews. And he loves Penny. Penny reminds him most of Brooklyn’s personality, and the animosity he sometimes feels towards James has him occasionally acting rather recklessly. He knows there is a line that shouldn’t be crossed, but sometimes it is hard to remember why.

Therapy didn’t do Matthew much good over the years, and per Matt’s request the guys still don’t talk about the past, about Brooklyn. He found a friend that listens, though, a friend who also lost someone he loved. Tanner Rhodes is also Matt’s best friend. Neither Tanner nor Rob like sharing Matt, which leads to a lot of crazy drama. Tanner’s role in Matt’s life is important because he needs someone to talk to about Brooklyn. With Tanner’s encouragement, Matt takes up Penny’s offer to help set him up on a date. She wants to play matchmaker, but he just wants the excuse to spend time with her. But Tanner being Tanner, he wants to be matchmaker, too. He wants control over the process. Soon word gets out and everyone wants to help Rob get matched – but only Tanner knows Matt’s true intentions, and Matt himself has a difficult time knowing his true feelings.

Things get complicated when Poppy Cannavaro shows up at Matt’s office one day. Isabella’s cousin not only resembles her in her looks, but also in her craziness. Poppy delivers a letter from her uncle, Richard Pruitt, who was Brooklyn’s father. Apparently Richard has been asking to meet with Matt for years, and Matt consistently ignores his requests, blaming him for what happened years ago. Matt has been wondering if it has something to do with the mountain of paperwork he signed when he was with Brooklyn – and wonders what kind of obligations he might be on the hook for yet. While there are still outstanding questions, Poppy makes one thing very clear before she leaves: if he doesn’t cooperate, something might happen to Scarlett.

As Matt struggles with the idea of moving on, he suddenly finds himself caught up in the past. Richard Pruitt is impossible to read and not at all to be trusted, and the same goes for his niece, Poppy. Matt is being pulled in different directions. Scarlett’s safety could depend upon him, but there is a lot that remains unresolved between him and James which further complicates matters. And when Kennedy returns to town, she brings with her a flood of old memories that threaten to distract him. Matt’s life of hotels and one night stands wasn’t a life he fully embraced but a life that helped him get by. Indulging Penny’s desire to play matchmaker opens him up to a whirlwind of mixed feelings and risk taking, which leave him off his game when Richard Pruitt finally gets serious about getting Matt’s attention. Kennedy’s entrance brings back all the memories of Brooklyn and Empire High that Matt has tried to get past. His memories of Kennedy are so closely linked with his memories of Brooklyn that Kennedy feels like home to him. As Matt warms to the idea of a second chance at love after Brooklyn, Kennedy might just be the next best thing. This book ends with a twist the changes everything!

But Matt seems to repeat some of his past mistakes here. He had failed to make Brooklyn his priority, keeping their relationship a secret most of the time while he kept Isabella at bay. In this book Poppy enters the picture with her own demands and he wants to keep his new friendship with Kennedy quiet until things settle down. Matt is also very distracted. He likes to keep busy, but he has a lot going on. Too much, it seems, for him to get his act together and do the right thing with talking to James and Penny. He definitely makes some mistakes. Matt may be great at running an international finance company and coaching high school football. He may be great at one night stands. He is great with kids. But when it comes to a lot of other things, Matt relies heavily upon others for guidance. He isn’t decisive and domineering like James.

A few issues merit mention. *Spoilers* I expected things going differently here – and I hope things yet go the way I had hoped! Hang in there, because this book is basically the setup for book five. Three books written in Brooklyn’s POV make it hard to embrace Matt with anyone else. Because the series is Matt’s story, that is basically a really big hint about the direction of the overall story. Kennedy enters the story here and her friendship with Matt picks back up easily. Kennedy was Brooklyn’s best friend, and sometimes that works in a story. I personally cannot get behind it here. The idea makes me cringe. I get the confusion they might experience when they see one another and the temptation to use one another as a crutch or a way to get close to old memories. I remember Kennedy feeling jealous of Brooklyn, and it just doesn’t feel right to me. At all. She had been smitten with Felix, and I had always envisioned him redeeming himself and coming back for her one day. Perhaps Kennedy will become like a Tyler or a Melissa character – someone otherwise nice but who will only ever be second best in the situation. Fingers crossed that Matt figures this out and moves on!

Those that have not read the books that occur chronologically between books three and four of this series will appreciate an update on Mason, Rob, and James.

Mason Caldwell is now about thirty-four and runs his own successful advertising firm with his wife Bee.

James Hunter is now about thirty-four and a self-made billionaire thanks to his tech startups. He pleased his parents by marrying Isabella and sincerely tried to make it work, but the marriage ended when he discovered her cheating. He met his wife Penny while teaching. She is now about twenty-seven. She is an aspiring author and mother of two. Their children are Scarlett, roughly four, and Liam, their infant son.

Rob Hunter, roughly thirty-two, decided to find himself after Harvard since he didn’t have any specific goals. He spent years living off of his parents’ money and travelling. When in Costa Rica for James’s bachelor party, he met his wife Daphne, a high school math teacher. Their children are Sophie, roughly four, and little RJ is an infant.

Get ready to see the Untouchables all grown up! Grab a tissue as Matt’s story begins in earnest with his own POV sixteen years after Brooklyn’s death. Matt – the only remaining Untouchable bachelor – gets help from Penny, who hopes to play matchmaker. But Penny reminds Matt of Brooklyn, so spending time with her is dangerous. Be prepared for a few big surprises. The story is well-written. The plot is quite complex and layered. The characters are carefully crafted and three-dimensional. The book is written in first person in Matt’s POV, with one chapter in Kennedy’s POV. I rate this book four stars.

I received an advance copy of this book and am voluntarily leaving a review.",MelissaB N NYC," August 12, 2019",5.0,dp
Inside out and upside down,"This was as a hard read. A tough one to get into at many points. Ivy is good - she made me feel for Matt throughout the book - his guilt at leaving Brooklyn with her father, his last words to her, his promise to always love her - just her -as long as he lived And rather than choose drugs or alcohol to deal with his feelings of loss and guilt, he uses one-night stands and an unrequired desire for a friend's wife. It made my heart ache for him, and I held my breath at each and every challenge thrown his way, hoping he would battle his way thru it and not cave in. He's a paradox, a grown man, head of a highly successful firm yet remains a teenage boy emotionally. That I got. But.... sixteen years of anguish, doing his best to keep his promise to the love of his life, and within two days of Kennedy's reappearance, it is suddenly gone - how does that make sense?? He cries on Brook's grave, gives into his grief in her bedroom of the apartment she shared wiht her uncle, then before we can draw a breath, he's retrieving Brooklyn's engagement ring from her grave and leading us to think he's planning to propose marriage to Kennedy? Sorry. Nope. Not buying it. Not unless it is to show us how really, really desperate Matt has become. He gives all the appearances of a drowning man grasping at the first life line he sees - not realizing it isn't tethered to anything solid. Kennedy has her own issues. and if she's looking to Matt for a cure, she's looking at the wrong man She's been brought up by a mother with strong faith and strict values about the relationships between men and women. Maybe she is totally unaware (yet) of all the hundreds of women Matt has bedded in the past, but given her upbringing, find it hard to believe that she will be able to get past that. And frankly - I don't see that she is an equal to any degree to the other Untouchables' women in these books. Penny is bold and determined - going after James despite all the obstacles thrown in her way. Bea is creative and resilient - exactly what Mason needs in a marriage and a business partner. Daphne is steady and compassionate - the perfect ying to Rob's yang, Kennedy is just.... there. Yes, she's a very successful photographer and its sweet that she figures out how to help Henry but that's it. No relationships since high school. She's spent the years since then in therapy and building her business. Seems like a pretty dull quiet existence, no real spark, certainly no fire. So I fail to see the attraction - other than she and Matt were friends in high school but even that was only because of Brooklyn. And even then she wasn't a good friend to Brooklyn. And now, falling for Matt ? Yes, Kennedy - you are stomping all over Brook's memory, not to mention making a mockery of the trust and friendship she gave you. So to the way the book ends, it will be interesting so see how all these so-called friendships play out or if they even survive. With the promise in the back notes that Brooklyn's character has become an amazing adult...leaves room to hope that her resurrection will finally force Matt to grow up and choose a partner worth sharing a life.
That said, I wanted to give this one 5 stars but just couldn't. The insertion of Tanner and Nigel just complicated the story's flow, drawing the attention away from the main storyline, and I ended up glossing over most of the pieces where they appeared. These two quirky, weird characters didn't fit well in EH4. And the times that they came close were just too far and few between to make it worthwhile. Their bizarre behavior and mannerisms were so over the top, it left little desire to even acknowledge them. Both need to be relegated strictly to the TSSP series where quirkiness is the norm. If this was for comic relief - just didn't rise to that level. I mostly cringed every time Nigel appeared or was mentioned. But if weird characters are your thing, this is the book for you. Just ignore all the non-bizarre human angst surrounding them.",Chelseas.bookshelf2," December 23, 2019",5.0,dp

arrrrrg,"I was not ready for this!! Ivy warned us there would be more laughs than tears, and yes this is very accurate!! This book had me laughing out loud numerous times!!! But THE ENDING!!! I read the Empire High books for the first time earlier this year, and I was okay knowing the next book was coming in a few months... but now I have to wait until 2022 for the next one?!

1. The Empire High Series is set in high school, but the story reads more like a college sports romance. If you are not a fan of YA I would still highly recommend this series! Matchmaker is set 16 years later after the 3rd book, so now we see adult Matt.

2. This series is MUCH tamer than Ivy's other books, so if you aren't not a fan of a lot of steam then this is the perfect series for you!

3. You can just read the Empire High Series to read this one, but I would also highly recommend reading The Hunted Series or at least This Is Love. Also maybe recommend reading City of Sin!

4. Rob has always been one of my favorite characters... but now I have two new top contenders! Tanner & Nigel ARE FRICKIN AMAZING! I absolutely LOVE the bromance Matt has with both Rob & Tanner, and they have some hilarious banter between Rob & Tanner. Then Nigel is seriously just the best, quirkest character yet! I am so excited for TSSP coming out later this year!

5. This book had the perfect amount of side characters. You get a good amount of Penny, James, Rob, Daphne, Mason, and Bee throughout this book. This is why I loved the Empire High Series. I just cannot get enough of the Untouchables!

6. Ivy is seriously the best romance writer. I love that she has life lessons throughout all of her books, especially the bullying messages. We are lucky that Ivy & Ryan work so hard and fast to produce new books for us. As much as I hate cliffhangers (because I'm super impatient), Ivy pulls them off so well. She writes in a way where we are deeply invested in these lovable characters and we care about what happens to them. While she creates some truly OUTSTANDING characters, she also creates some of the WORST characters I have ever read. By worst I mean I want to stab them or cause them harm because Ivy is just that good of a writer. These novels she creates are truly unique, and they are not 'just another romance novel'. These characters will stay with me forever. Yes Betrayal left me completely gutted, but I still understand where Ivy was going with the story. I hope Ivy knows her true fans love her & will continue reading anything she releases!

,"I started this series a few weeks ago and absolutely loved it. I absolutely adored Matt and Brooklyn and was crushed when Brooklyn died, though my first thought was that her father helped fake her death to possibly save her from psycho Isabella. I had time to kill before this conundrum was released so I read all of the James and Penny books. I fell more in love with Matt's character. Which brings me to this book. I patiently waited for this book and I binge read it today. Got to say, even hours later, I still am unsure of my feelings.
*********************************SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS ****************************************

I loved a lot about this book: TANNER is so hilarious, he lightens up the mood. I feel Ivy did a great job using humor to break up the somber tone, and at times, I felt I was drowning along with Matt. Tanner had Matt's back, really supportive. I also enjoyed Tanner's ridiculous competition and banter with Rob. NIGEL: Mysterious side character. I can't wait to read more about him. I found him to be a funny addition as well. MATT: He's my favorite of The Untouchables. I am glad that he finally was able to breathe again. (I found myself catching my breath when he had a panic attack). Glad he was able to forgive and let himself finally start to live in the present again.
Did not love: PENNY: although she herself was going through emotional issues, I feel she used Matt to hide from her own problems by insisting on finding girls for Matt to date. I found her annoying and pushy in this book. JAMES, ROB AND MASON: although they all agreed not to talk about Brooklyn, I feel that they watched and did nothing to help Matt over the years. They could have put aside their own issues and at least supported Matt by going to his practices and games. Come on now, Tanner realized Matt needed that and was there for him. POPPY: Really?? Another branch of black-mailing craziness from the Pruitt family?? MR. PRUITT: What's with his vague demands over the years. When Matt finally confronts him, MR. Pruitt tells him he was protecting him for years. Makes a big deal about the relationship contract. Then, he makes a comment to Matt that he didn't know Brooklyn as well as he thought. Makes me wonder is Brooklyn going to be the hit-woman that was supposedly hired by Mr Pruitt. I have every hope that Matt and Brooklyn end up together but that leads me to my last and most strongest dislike....KENNEDY: didn't like her character in the earlier books and I didn't like her in this one for Matt. I hope hope hope that it is just mis-guided interest for him. He did mention numerous times that she felt like home to him. Maybe it's his subconscious connecting to her Brooklyn connection????

Mixed feelings on this one,"Holy cow! I had such high expectations going into Empire High Matchmaker, that it made me nervous going into it. I was so afraid of being disappointed, but I can tell you this book did not disappoint. Empire High Matchmaker was everything that I was hoping it would be, and so much more.
Empire High matchmaker picks up 16 years after the events of Empire High Betrayal . All of the Untouchables are married off and have moved on with their lives. Matt is New Yorks most eligible bachelor, but he is stuck living in the past, refusing to let his love for Brooklyn go and filling his nights with meaningless one-night stands. You can tell he has pent up anger towards James, and maybe there is a little jealousy because James got everything Matt ever wanted. Matt agrees to let Penny set up a dating profile for him, but its only to get closer to her as he has some inappropriate thoughts about her. This leads to disastrous dates, and makes you wonder if Matt will ever get his happily ever after. It also leads to the question of will Matt let go of Brooklyn, and allow himself to fall in love?
Empire High Matchmaker introduces new characters (hello Ash, Nigel, and Tanner) and familiar faces. This book is a genuine roller coaster ride. It will make you laugh so hard that you almost pee your pants, and your heart will ache for Matthew.
Ivy is so good at building these characters, and the world that they live in, that you have to question are they based on real people? Ivy has a way of making you form an emotional attachment to the characters, that you find yourself rooting for them, wanting them to be happy, and on some occasions, you want to punch them in the face for being so stupid.
Going into this book, you are going to want answers to the questions that Betrayal leaves. Empire High Matchmaker will leave you with more questions than answers. Ivy is the queen of cliffhangers, so it would not be an Ivy book without a cliffhanger. The cliffhanger will make the next book seem so far away, when really its only 358 days away (at the absolute latest, and at the time this review was written. Not that I’m counting or anything)

If you love Ivy’s work, check this book out. If you have not read anything by her, then what are you waiting for??",Rustin Ham," December 23, 2019",5.0,dp
,"So, at first, I was kind of annoyed that Matt wanted Penny. Every guy in this series seemed to want Penny. Well, okay, not every guy. Just a few.

Sixteen years ago, Matthew Caldwell lost everything. But Matt didn’t realize that he was not the only one who lost someone that night. The Untouchables—Mason, James, & Rob lost Matt that night. Matt was never the same after the tragedy of losing the person that mattered to him the most. He was existing, but not living. He was going through life but has always been stuck in the past. He didn’t allow himself to be happy because of the promise he made to Brooklyn sixteen years ago. Until someone from his past made an unexpected appearance back in his life.

Kennedy Alcaraz, the brown-eyed girl who comforted & understood what Matt went through sixteen years ago ignited that fire in him. He was able to breathe again. She too found comfort with Matt. After sixteen years, they picked up where they left off as if time & distance had never put a gap between them. They gravitated towards each other no matter how much they wanted to ignore their feelings. In their minds, it all seemed wrong. Matt felt like he was breaking the promise he made Brooklyn. Kennedy felt like she was betraying her best friend. After all, Matt was supposed to live happily ever after with Brooklyn, & Kennedy was Brooklyn’s best friend.

When they finally realized that fighting their feelings is no longer an option, they had to move on & find happiness. Even if they found happiness in each other’s arms because that was what Brooklyn would have wanted. But the sound of someone knocking behind Kennedy’s apartment door could end her story with Matthew Caldwell before it began.

Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. There were a few surprises & lots of funny moments between Rob & Tanner. I love that all the characters I adored were a huge part of this book. New characters were also introduced. Even Cupcake & Felix were mentioned.

The book ended brilliantly, & left me eagerly wanting to know what happens next. Talk about a major book hangover. I cannot wait to read how Matthew Caldwell’s story unfolds. An absolute must-read.",K. Doherty," December 23, 2019",5.0,dp

You got me! Lol,"I have to say I do enjoy reading your books! I will be honest though, I was a little mad/upset at you at the end of book 3 and most of book 4, but I kept telling myself, ""no she didn't just kill Brooklyn off, there has to be more, a twist."" Lol Especially since I've already read all 7 books about James and Penny, and remember all those twists. Lord you had me on the edge the whole time with them! Hahaha! I couldn't stop reading them. There were nights I didnt go to sleep because I couldn't stop reading. Lol Luckily I was working from home, so it wasn't too bad on me not sleeping. Lol That serious was one of the 1st books I read after I got Kindle. It was actual the 1st of your books I read.

Even though I was a little mad/upset, I read book 4. I couldn't give up on ya. For most of it I just couldn't let go of the feeling Brooklyn wasn't really dead. But then toward the end I kind of thought maybe I was just really, really wishing she wasn't dead so that was why I was feeling like that, and then there you go again with the twists! You almost got me. Hahaha! I have to say, it is killing me I can't go straight into book 5.

I just want to say, you are a great author, and you should be very proud of yourself and your work! Don't let the hate in, just keep doing you! People are going to hate, and be mean. Unfortunately, that is human nature now it seems, but don't let those people in to get you down. Never let them dull your shine, and keep the plots, twists, and turns coming! Thanks again for the great reads!

,"After reading the first three books I was so nervous about going into Matchmaker. If you read those you may be feeling the same way. The fear of the unknown is a scary thing.
The many fans of Ivy Smoak are very much aware that she is the diabolical QUEEN of killer cliffhangers! She also has the amazing talent to bring us into this world of fiction that feels so real. She brings the characters to life and has us wrapped in every emotion possible.
We begin Matchmaker 16 years after book 3 of the series. We find Matt stuck in life not moving forward. Hanging onto his promises and vows to Brooklyn.
Ivy takes us on a journey through sadness, grief, guilt, tears, danger, humor, hope and love.
She introduces some new characters and we see some familiar ones too.
Tanner and Nigel oh boy what a pair. Tanner is a quirky fun guy that has the best bromance with Matt their chemistry is unbelievable. Now Nigel and Matt that’s a whole different hilarious part of the book. They along with the old gang and a new face will keep you entertained in this one.
Like I said I was anxious going in but when you’re a fan of an other author you really need to put your personal preferences, thoughts and ideas aside because this is Ivys story to tell. Her hard work, her time spent writing, her tears and her love that is poured into every page.
Give it a chance you may not like everything (I know I didn’t like a certain situation but that’s my personal opinion) but the way it was written was very well done.
I really believe this was the best book yet! Atleast until the next one comes out lol
Thank you Ivy for your perseverance and a job well done.
You have “Smoaked” me again with this one especially with that killer cliffhanger!!!!",Brenda DeJesus," January 5, 2020",1.0,dp
Smoaked again…..,"I gave it five stars to a very talented well deserved writer.
I am so invested in this series that when Ivy concluded The Hunted series I was so sad. I was so elated that she decided to go back into the characters younger years in The Empire high series to the point where book#4 continues into their The Hunted series intwind with Empire high characters into adulthood. There will be spoilers from here on. I began reading was very upset with Matt flirting and trying to break up James & Penny marriage, Penny being so naive about it. Especially since Matt kept on confessing that he could never love anyone , but Brooklyn so WTF is he thinking James is one of his closest friends its time Matt grew up. I thought the character Tanner was hilarious and I think he's the new Rob. Then there's weird Nigel and his British accent and his weird attachment to Matthew. I loved that they bought Kennedy, Mrs. Alcaraz, Justin, Mr Pruitt and Poppy because now that Isabella is dead we need a replacement. I totally love where this is headed. BROOKLYN'S ALIVE!!!!! I'm a little suspicious that Jefferson's Mom is Brooklyn she's back from hiding and that was what Mr. Pruitt had wanted to talked to Matt about, but Matt never gave him the chance to talk. Now I'm not sure how I feel about Kennedy and Matt falling in love even though they both believe Brooklyn dead its still a Betrayal because Kennedy was Brooklyn's best friend, but its going to make an interesting book #5. Matt saying goodbye to Brooklyn at her grave was heart-rending, Matt blind date with Ash was hilarious 😆 all in all it was a wonderful read a great book the minute it was released at midnight eastern time 9pm for me I started to read and kept on going till the sun came out.

,"Ivy Smoak, you have done it again. Dropped a bomb and just left me hanging in the wind. I swear I didn’t see that ending coming because this story was nothing like I expected. This story picks up sixteen years later so teenage Matt is all grown up and still terribly heartbroken. His angst just bleed through the page until my heart hurt with him. Now I do have to admit that I was not a big fan of the beginning of this book. Even though Matt was hurting, his thoughts and actions were starting to turn me off. I was starting to get nervous at the route I thought this story was trying to go but I stayed patient because Ivy has never let me down before. She also introduces some very interesting characters that will leave you laughing and scratching your head in confusion at the same time. Right around the fifty percent mark, things started to change and the story turned into something I suspected but was never sure it would happen. That ending though was a 𝑔𝒶𝓂𝑒 𝒸𝒽𝒶𝓃𝑔𝑒𝓇.

"Matchmaker, Heartbreaking, funny, incredible, surprising,","For me, Ivy’s books are it all! I’ve searched and searched after catching up and re-reading all she’s published and literally cannot find anything to compare.
When EHB ended....I was devastated. I felt crushed and hurt and was counting the days, weeks and months for EHM.
I knew, or hoped, deep down that Ivy wouldn’t let us down.
Honestly though, EHM was not my favorite. At least not for this series.
I re-read the series (first 3) in 2 days leading up to EHM’s release. I wanted to remember every detail of this story line. I cried in all the same places and was ready to live in Matt’s despair.
I wasn’t ready for the comedy, the mix of new characters, the stumbles Matt took and very little lack of events to rebuilt the storyline. The last 1/4 of the book got better for me, but I honestly struggled to get through the rest.
On its own, I think it’s brilliant still. I love Matt and the cast of characters we’ve come to know through Ivy’s series - but I was not ready for EHM following the intense emotions and LOVE of EHB.

Ivy - this is an open and honest review from a devoted fan. I hope you don’t take offense to it and know I will continue to anxiously await ALL of your releases. For me, this book just took a turn of emotions I wasn’t expecting or ready for. Your words in the ending hurt me as a true fan and literary “friend”. I watch you and Ryan on your lives and giggle with you. I cannot imagine how so many could be so hateful towards you. Just move on if they want, but no reason to be hateful or hurtful. Keep your chin up and OWN that #1 Amazon spot!!!!! Slay girl!",Amazon Customer," January 6, 2020",1.0,dp
,"I’m Speechless....

*No Spoilers*

Going into this book, I honestly had no idea what to expect- especially given how shockingly the previous one ended and the fact that this book is set 16 years later.
But Ivy has always been excellent with weaving the most beautiful stories and she had my complete trust. So going into this book, my expectations were high.

She EXCEEDED them.

This was her BEST work so far, Hands Down!! I was laughing so hard I was crying literal tears and my face and side hurt. Other parts, I wanted to reach through the book and hug Matt... I could FEEL what he was going through and wanted to comfort him! (Yes, I’m aware that he’s a fictional character). That is a sure sign of an Amazing author. It wasn’t just words written on a page - it was emotional, angsty, hilarious, devastating, hopeful, colorful, strange (in a fun, quirky way), and most of all.... it was BEAUTIFUL. A beautiful story that was even more Beautifully written.

LISTEN: if you gave up on this series because of how the previous book ended and you are here scoping out the reviews, conflicted on whether or not you should pick this one up, I am here to tell you: You Will Be Missing Out On So Much If You Choose Not To Read This Book. So much that I cannot even describe it all to you. I am so glad I didn’t quit after EHB. If you’re on the fence, I’m letting you know now that you will not regret giving this story a chance.

I need to know why Tanner and Nigel act so weird around Matt, especially at Tanner’s penthouse. I loved reading from Matt’s point of view, even though he keeps hurting my heart. I just want him to be happy. I’m happy that he reunited with Kennedy but I don’t want him to forget Brooklyn too much because I miss her and I loved them together. Also, where is Felix?

,"I started this series late. And with the next book coming out soo. I'm so glad that I did. I'm not sure how anyone could of waited for the next one without out insane after that cliffhanger!!

Matchmaker is book 4 is the Empire High Series. It take place 16 yes I said 16 years after that epic....heartbreaking ending in Betrayal. It is told entirely by Matthew. And did my heart hurt for him. He's broken. What happened to Brooklyn didn't just brake him it shattered him. He's going through life the man he didn't think he would ever be. He's still thick as thrives with his boys/brothers. But they're all happy and married. Living the life Matthew was supposed to have.

He needed a sign that everything would be OK and that person was someone we wouldn't of excepted. She might be his shot at a new beginning but then the unexpected happeneds and were left with our mouths in the floor! Each book in this series has had a mind blowing cliffhanger but this one....i dont even have the words.

,"I really wished I would have stopped and read the blurbs of all of the books in this series before I picked up and started reading the first one. I’m not a fan of cliffhangers, but I love a series that explores different couples within an universe. If I would have known that this book ended on such a cliffhanger, I would have waited until March to start reading the entire series. Now, onto the review…
This book is written strictly from Matt’s POV (aside from the last chapter) and for the first 20-25% I almost gave up. There are some questionable choices and decisions being made that I just didn’t agree with. Not to mention that this book does pick up 16 years after book 4. That honestly does not bother me. I know Matt’s story is interwoven into all of the other series (I haven’t read any of the others yet), but it makes sense to give a back story before jumping to the present. However, some of the relationships felt forced. Tanner and Nigel feel very paranormal-esque which made me not love their characters. There were funny moments with them, but I found them to be a bit weird and too eccentric for my taste. Lastly, for most of the book I was looking for Brooklyn and her presence was sorely missed. She’s the one bright spot from all of the previous books that made them so unique and special. She’s definitely missed in this one. (Oh! And Ash is hilarious and I can’t wait to read her book!)
Hopefully the next installment is the last installment of Matt’s story because I can guarantee I can’t take any more of this roller coaster after book 5.",Holly J. Margaritis," February 27, 2023",1.0,dp
Just okay…,"I’m not crying, you are! Thank you Ivy for book 4! I don’t think I’m emotionally ready to review it but here we go! This book starts 16 years after Brooklyn passed. We get to see the emotional rollercoaster Matt is going through dealing with grief & feeling guilty every time he thinks about Brooklyn! In comes Kennedy & man, I didn’t know how to feel about that, because I’m team Brooklyn through & through. But I also trusted Ivy to work her magic throughout this book and boy, she delivered!

Omgggg Ivy!!!!!! You did it again!,"I was really looking forward to this book, and while parts of it were good, there were elements that just did not mesh with the overall series at all. *Spoilers* I thought the character Tanner started off well enough, but the further I moved into the novel the stranger his relationship with Matt became. There were obvious supernatural or time-traveler elements hinted at throughout this portion of the narrative and they really came out of left field and got crazier the more the book progressed. Thus far in the series, it has always seemed solidly realistic fiction so this element felt increasingly off and disjointed from the rest of the plot. This also felt true of the introduction of Nigel. Am I in a fantasy novel now? I felt myself really opposed to this turn the more it seemed to push through as a more primary plot line especially since this series is ongoing and the supernatural really hasn’t even made a hint of an appearance prior to now. At first, I thought Tanner was some “guardian angel” character sent in some mystical way by Brooklyn meant to guide Matt to some true happiness. This in my mind had some plausibility, and I could see that reasonably worked in, but now I think it’s turning into something else entirely. I don’t see myself loving it. In fact, I found myself skipping those sections entirely because I was so put off by it. Early in the novel, I assumed Brooklyn was alive and would make a reappearance, and I kept waiting for that moment, but then the romance with Kennedy made me second guess that theory. Maybe Brooklyn was truly dead and this book was ultimately about moving on and second chances? Nope, apparently not and one of these characters that I’ve really invested in will lose out in a major way. Also, the addition of Ash as a seemingly parallel love interest for Matt was also confusing. Were we meant to root for this funny, mess of a girl or not? Was she comic relief? And once Kennedy emerged as the primary love interest, Ash’s role in the plot seemed to have no point. Then finally we have the grand cliff-hanger. Truthfully, how are you going to reconcile all this nonsense at this point? There was a good book in there somewhere, but the author’s editor was clearly asleep at the wheel or ignored. The supernatural has no place in this series. That idea should have been a separate book. Will I read the next book? Probably, just to see how this could even possibly be pulled off. Sadly, I don’t have high hopes unless the weirdness with Tanner and Nigel is stopped entirely and it may be too late since that train wreck seems to be moving full speed ahead.",," February 27, 2023",1.0,dp
,"Ivy, this is probably my favorite book you've written yet. It is very well written and edited! I'm very much looking forward to the next book. I've come to expect cliff hangers from Ivy, but do wish she would warn people. I think she'd receive less negative reviews if people knew the series wasn't complete. That said, I loved the ending and just knew Brooklyn would be back!! I'm very interested to see where she's been the last 16 years. I would have given this 5 stars, but the more I thought about the book the more I thought it deserved 4. I agree with a lot of other reviews that this could have been a much shorter book and that there was a lot of filler. Tanner and Nigel were very interesting additions, but do feel they were fillers. Obviously, she's got another book coming out with them as characters or she probably wouldn't have included them. Glad she didn't mess with Penny and James's relationship! Phew.

I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and at the very end I knew who was at the door. I honestly thought she would surprise Matt at the grave. I kept getting angry with him for not talking to Mr. Pruitt because I knew Mr. Pruitt wanted to tell him the truth. Now I wonder if Mr. Pruitt didn't send Brooklyn back just to stop ole Poppy. I also wonder WHERE THE HELL HAS SHE BEEN FOR 16 YEARS?!! Did she not see Matt suffering? Has she turned into the Mob boss? OMG so many questions!! I can not wait an entire year!!

She knows how to write captivating characters who we love so deeply that we feel their pain, betrayal, joy, hope, and even disappointment at times. It's like these are real story's that we are so invested in. I love that she didn't right the classic happy ending because I love the roller coaster ride she has us on. I trust Ivy that when the last book is done we will all be happy with the ending.

The best part about a rollercoaster is the rush and fear before and during the big drops. That is what the end of EHB and all of EHM where for me. A huge Rollercoaster drop and at the every end of the book is where the drop ended and we are now excited for all the loops and spins coming with the next books.

Don't be angry if this book didn't go how you wanted. Just trust in Ivy and see what happens next. I'm sure this ride isn't even close to being over.

Cliff Hanger,"Did I love this book?? Yes. Having lost the love of my life I could feel Matt's pain. But, Spoiler Alert.....

Part of me knew that Brooklyn was alive. The last scene with her, she felt like she had lost everyone she cared about, and discovered that the Father she thought loved her only wanted her for her kidney. I think it was Brooklyn who orchestrated her own death. She walked away, but I think the good part of her may have died. I am hoping not. I am worried that the person Mr. Pruitt was protecting Matt from is Brooklyn and the reason he is so emotional is because he took someone that was sweet and loving, like her mother, and created another Pruitt. I am hoping I'm wrong. This is why I prefer to read completed series. Having to wait until 2022 is torture. So why did I read this series, because Ivy's writing.

Matt & Brooklyn are literally addicting, and this book of her being gone for 16 years made me feel so relatable. I feel like I would be exactly where Matt was. I’m an extreme faithful loyal person and I don’t feel like I could have the guts or the ability dishonor someone else’s memory for my own life. Which is f*caked up honestly. But like I said it’s relatable for me. I have to say the ONLY thing I could express that would have made the books “better” are more detailed passion scenes.

Ivy you’re amazing!,"I loved the Empire High series and the latest book, Empire High Matchmaker, is the best book yet!

Sixteen years after he lost the love of his life, Matthew Caldwell is devastated and unable to move on. He pretends to be happy around his friends but he's stuck. He gave up all hope of having love, a house and a family when he lost her.

His friends aren't happy that sixteen years later, Matthew is stuck. Everyone else has their HEA but not Matt. So they all set out to play Matchmaker for him, including some new (very humorous) friends.

One of my favorite scenes is his blind date. I was laughing out loud because she was so awkwardly cute, yet this embarrassing situation was so hilariously funny! I'd recommend this book for that scene alone (even though there are so many amazing scenes!!!)

In true Ivy Smoak fashion, she provides a cliffhanger ending that leaves the reader longing for the next book (but we love Ivy and wouldn't want her any other way). I'm really looking forward to more of Matt's adventures in the next book!

Matt, never having moved on from Brooklyn has an infatuation with Penny who reminds him of Brooklyn. Stuck in the past he is desperately trying to move on, all the while meddling Penny is playing Matchmaker. After a horrible blind date that nearly got him seriously hurt, Matt is slipping deeper into the depths of depression and everyone is noticing it.

But along comes ""New Girl"". Like winds from the East, she floats in on her magical umbrella (yes I am using Mary Poppins as a metaphor) and saves Matt...Or does she? Even Mary Poppins was never a permanent thing. She is just the new infatuation to get over the last (Penny) and a reminder of Brooklyn. 

As if that wasn't enough, we have Poppy, Isabella's cousin. Poppy takes the book by storm when she makes threats towards people Matt cares deeply about.

In between getting deep insight to how Matt has been all these years we get to meet new characters who break up ththe emotional rollercoaster with fits of laughter and What The F moments.

• Matt (the MMC) has absolutely zero control over his own life, apparently.

• I get the feeling Poppy's plans are more convoluted than what she's saying. Matt is the one in danger, and he's a pawn in Poppy's game against the rightful heir of the family?

I didn’t want him to fall for Kennedy because their story could be so incredible right? I don’t want to be spoilt over the two girls. Sometimes I hated Brooklyn’s character and yet loved her too.

so difficult,"This book was an amazing way to start Matt’s adult story, there was a lot of character development here because we had to figure out who Matt is as an adult and how he sees his friends from his point of view. If you read the other books from this series you didn’t get to know just Matt. Of course the ending was going to be what it was because there are 2 more books for him to figure out his feelings because he’s going to be completely shook when he finds out she’s alive. This next book is going to be so much more of a rollercoaster. Ivy Smoak you are an amazing author and made it to #1 in the kindle store on release day. You have such an amazing way of make all my emotions come to surface and have people around me question my sanity lol and I’ve never read so many books in one sitting. Thank you for being you! ❤️💕",H.," May 3, 2022",5.0,dp

Woah,"Loved it! I actually read this book right after release but after reading The Society #stalkerproblems and The Society #tanner from Tanners POV, immediately following, I had to reread this! My love for Tanner, Matt, Ash, and even that little weirdo Nigel, knows no bounds! If you’re reading this please give these books a try.

I personally loved the ending! 😳 I can’t wait for book 5

Ivy... I’m just gonna come out and say it, I think, maybe, we would be best friends. I know, I know, you probably hear it all the time. The way that you write is a beautiful, chaotic, dream! The characters that escape your mind are fascinating, amazing, unique, hilarious, sexy, and so much more! Thank you once again for transporting me to a world that I gladly dove in head first!

,"If you love Ivy and all of her previous books, this book delivers!! My disclaimer though is that if you have blood pressure, anxiety disorder or ragey tendencies you should pause and wait until the next book comes out to read this for your own health. You may want to scream at times and fall apart…thus knowing that up front save yourself and wait longer….I on the other hand have no such patience and am going to require the emotional support group that is the matchmaker facebook spoiler room. Either way have a plan in place because feelings will be felt.

Next piece of advice, be kind to Ivy! It is a gift to be able to send us on these emotional roller coasters….that is why we are hooked!! If you can remember that prior to and during your reading it will help!!!

This book like all of the books written by Ivy Smoak are never disappointing,"I really like everything Ivy writes. Her story lines are entertaining and characters are relatable. The only reason for not giving five stars is because I think she spends too much time on inner dialogue where the character continually goes back and forth with their feelings. ""I love him, I don't love him. I trust him, I don't trust him. Etc."" Indecision is ok but it tends to be excessive in all of Ivy's books. None the less, the stories are good reads.",Krystal," May 3, 2022",5.0,dp
,"I love the book; I hate that I have to wait a year for the next installment. I’m glad it dealt with past issues between James and Matt. I also like that the crush that Matt had on Penny wrapped up and they became better friends. I think the problem some people had with the book was they expected for Brooklyn to be alive from the beginning and that by the end her and Matt would have there happily ever after. Not me, I hate when characters are brought back from the dead. Like everyone else I cried my eyes out when Brooklyn died I felt for Matt, Kennedy, and the whole gang.but even in Betrayal i didn’t think that Brooklyn was loyal to Matt or Kennedy. I went into this book hoping Kennedy would come back and her and Matt would end up together. I’m still on team Matthew and Kennedy! I also loved the introduction of Tanner and Nigel!!! Can’t wait!!!!",reading junkie," May 3, 2022",5.0,dp
How do I put this into words?,"I'm not sure how to express what I'm feeling. I absolutely love Brooklyn and Matt so the ending to book 3 was shocking. This one was a surprisingly difficult read and I won't lie, I was beyond frustrated and at times furious with Ivy for the torture here. We're all rooting for Matt and Brooklyn. Rooting hard. I will admit that this is not my favorite book in the EH series. It's well written but definitely not my favorite to read. My biggest peeve is the bomb dropped at the end and having to wait another year for the next book.
This is a solid read series that rivals any emotional read though. I recommend the series as a whole. I wish it was next year so we could have our answers we so desperately want and need.",Tara Kaufman," May 3, 2022",5.0,dp
,"I have read all the compete series in order, and have to say, Ivy is one of my favorite authors.
Definitely doesn't disappoint in all the twists, turns, and emotions. She connects the reader to each of the characters so they become invested in the storyline.
""Matchmaker"" is one of those. I reread book #3 the day before this was release just to refresh the story line and characters.
The heartache that Matt feels for 16 years is painful to read. The promise he made, and the way he lived his life to keep that promise.
Without giving anything away, I hope ""all"" the characters in the last scene get their true happiness.
But most of all Matt deserves complete happiness the same as the other UnTouchables have found.
It' going to be hard to wait til 2022, but I have already marked my calendar. I won't be disappointed.

Fantastic Series,"Wow, what they heck just happened???!!!!! I have to be honest I am not a fan of Kennedy and Matt together. I just don't feel the chemistry. But there is something brewing in this book that I think is gonna explode in book 5 & 6. There is a lot going on that is not explained. What the heck is going on with Tanner and Nigel??? What is Tanner hiding ? Who is Nigel? Whats up with the 'hitwoman'? And Jefferson and his Mom. Something is going on there too. Mr. Pruitt, I honestly feel like he's not as bas as he should be.

,"This is my very first review, but because I have become a diehard Ivy fan, I thought I owed it to her and her other fans to review this book. This was the first book I was truly excited for and waited for, couldn’t wait for release day! That being said, perhaps I had unrealistic expectations. Overall I would give the book around a 3.5 stars. I have to say it was just OK, more on the predictable side, a little bland with the suspense aspect. I feel part of the book was rushed and unfinished, lacking on development in areas, I the hopes of instilling suspense, but falling short. Definitely not as good as her others, but they can’t all be home runs. Don’t get me wrong, there were absolutely some fun parts that made me chuckled but no belly laughs. There were a few far reaching parts that made me raise my eyebrows in question...not enough for me to long for the next book with the hope for answers though. They sometimes seemed forced and out of place. There were a few new and interesting characters introduced- and I will definitely read the associated book when it is released.
I am already looking forward to book 5. It has the potential to be something amazing.",Lucretia," January 31, 2022",5.0,dp
What the What??!!! More questions then answers. Book 5 hurry up please.,"This book was a roller coaster, from start to finish like all the books Ivy writes! I felt her love and her pain with every word. The world these books take place in lives within her and so she puts herself into every word.

I had theories about this book, like all the Smoaksters did. But I am blown away with this book!!! I felt every moment. I cannot wait to see what happens next!

Yes, cliff hangers are rough especially when we have to wait a whole year before seeing what's next! But I know that Ivy and Ryan will help us through that time with their love, kindness, and presence on Social Media.

I kept thinking she is alive and hoping that she would come back!!! I know Kennedy needs her happiness, but Brooklyn needs Matt!

Stand up double,I chose a 3 rating because I did not like Matthews life and attitude during this book. His personality made him unlikable in my opinion. I was bored with him to the point that I wasn't keen on finishing the book. I did however because it is important not to miss what happened with him to understand how the story continues in the final story. I am wondering who he will end up with.

,"The best for description for Book Four is an EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER, so many ups and downs I could never maintain my balance. After Brooklyn's death Matt could not maintain his emotional stability; he was almost happy one day, and struggling to seem just okay the next. Envious of his friends relationships, Matt couldn't find his way until a ghost from the past returns to center him.

I can’t get myself to more stars,"I loved meeting a new author through this series. She’s truly talented in words. I’ve had to mourn that she’s just not the author for me. I don’t do well with so many books and ongoing angst again and again. I didn’t realize book 1 was part of a series, dived in and then bam a cliffhanger...wait a month...wait again...wait 6mos....wait a year....

The waits, teasers & tricks in reader group - created so much ongoing unnecessary anxiety in my own life. I tried to stick by and ride the path, but determined with this book I need to let go.

It all feels very much a marketing ploy to sell more money or make a dream of #1 in store happen. I get it, but that doesn’t show putting your customers & readers first. If readers were the focus there wouldn’t be so many books to fill empty space, as shown with this book. This is a space filler. All the words & twists were so the end could have a one word cliffhanger. So much could have been taken out to put more of the plot. Matt is not a book boyfriend to me. Their love story is cheapened due to timing of all the randomness & I don’t see it redeemed in my head. I’m not left loving anything or feeling like while emotional it was all worth my time. It doesn’t stay with me as a good emotion or challenge my way of thinking. I feel another dupe coming, another bit of anxiety, another twist thrown in for the purpose of angst.

These are all feelings, it doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate the author and their craft. It means I’ve determined I just can’t mentally be considered a true fan. I know the author is writing for them and killing it.",Chugs930," January 24, 2022",5.0,dp

He deserves Brooklyn. I’m not keen on him and Kennedy. But I guess because Brooklyn has always been his everything and they went through so much in such a short time it’s painful to think of him and Kennedy. But I guess we’ll have to wait for the next book to see. I know Ivy will get it perfect so I just wish it would release before next year. As for Tanner I don’t know what to think about him and Nigel.

Some spoilers so proceed with caution….,"I've read a lot of Ivy's books and am starting to see a pattern. A series will start out good in the first two or three books and then begin to morph into the ridiculous, at least in part, and of course with cliffhanger after cliffhanger. Well that seems to be the case here. The first two books were very good, the third was good, but started to incorporate some unrealistic scenarios, and now half of this fourth installment is bordering on silly and ridiculous.

At first, I really was engaged in this series, wondering if Brooklyn was actually gone and what would happen to Matt; but it seems the story is being dragged out with forced fillers just to extend the series into more books, and I'm starting to lose interest. However, with the shocking cliffhanger in Matchmaker, I just might take a look into the next book, especially since it's available with Amazon Unlimited.",Paige Joyner," February 17, 2023",5.0,dp
,"Enjoyed reading this series. I didn't really like the character being killed off, but I did know that she was not dead. I normally read interracial books. When I first started this, I thought that's what I was reading, and realized a little bit later that it was not what I thought it was. With that being said, I really did enjoy Brooklyn and Matt's story. It is well worth the read, I only gave it a four-star rating, because now I'm going to have to wait until next year to read the last book.

Ivy mentions in the author's note that many readers were angry and vicious in their attacks against her regarding the ending of Book 3. Really, people. If you became attached to the characters it's only because the author skillfully brought them to life, allowing them to touch your life. To attack the writer because she killed off a character is insane! She's writing the story and has reasons for what happens. If you're that upset by the events that unfold it's because you were living the story along with the characters...because of the author! If you don't want to get lost in a book, or a movie, or a play because you may not like the ending then don't read or be entertained. Or accept the twist and read on!

I love ivy but this was a no no noo for me,"****Contains Spoilers****

Let me start off by saying Ivy is absolutely amazing. She can pull her readers into a story like only few Authors can. She has a way of writing that makes you feel emotionally connected to these characters. You love when they love, your hurt when they hurt, you laugh when they laugh, you cry when they cry. You truly feel the emotions and the situations they go through. There aren’t many authors out there who can capture that raw emotion for their readers like Ivy can.

With that being said Matchmaker is the 4th book in the Empire High series, honestly my favorite series by Ivy. This book had me feeling some type of way. I was so hurt for Matt my heart literally broke. I also wanted to jump through the pages and slap him for his actions and trying to hurt James.

I ended up giving this book 2 stars because it felt like it was used to set up her new book. This felt like a filler book. On top of feeling like a filler book there was just too much going on. We had 3 books from Brooklyn’s POV. I’m more invested in Brooklyn than Matt at this point to be honest. Matt hooking up with Brooklyn’s best friend was it for me on this book. It was disgusting. It ruined the book. If this is the direction the book is going she should of left Brooklyn dead and started a new series for Matt.",Angela Oram," November 12, 2014",1.0,dp

Not in a horrible way, but in a, I can’t stop thinking about Brooklyn, she can’t be gone kinda way. I held onto some hope that she wasn’t gone and was so angry with Matt and Kennedy when they started trying to date. I was also angry with Matt for refusing to speak with her dad. Great writing, but angering plot. Which is exactly what I love to read. I want to feel something when I read. Ivy did just that! I’m very IMPATIENTLY waiting for book 5… I gotta know what happens!!!",Kindle Customer," June 16, 2021",4.0,dp
,"Holy hell!!! I never leave reviews. And I was devastated after the last book. But I’m so glad I decided to read this one. If you followed the series, this is a must read. I think I cried just as much through this one as I did in the last book. It’s going to be hard to wait until the next book comes out, but I can’t wait to see how this all plays out. I won’t spoil it but the ending was a shocker. Wow is all I can say. Can’t wait!!!

Great book,Ivy’s books are so well written and I’m reading one a day. You can’t wait to find out what happens next. Book 3 I needed a box of Kleenex and then book 4 got happier. Thanks by the way for giving us a little info as to what happened to Penny and her pregnancy! I had a feeling all along reading book 4 and then the bomb dropped and confirmed what I thought might happen since Mr. Pruitt was being so secretive with his messages.

,"I don’t know. I hate to do this because I did enjoy the original Empire High and the books about about James Hunter but this book was tooo quirky to me. The Empire High books were more serious and to continue the series with Matt and make it a comedy just didn’t do it for me. I found myself skimming. And the story line with him and Kennedy was wayyyy too fast. And I didn’t enjoy Tanner at all. He didn’t fit. He’s not part of the gang. It’s like he was a main character in the story and I felt like there was a lot of wasted time with him just for comedic sake. There were too many weird insignificant characters I could care less about. If Ivy would have this style of writing in a completely different story then maybe it would be okay, but it didn’t do Matt justice at all. He sounded completely immature. And this book was predictable. I assumed the ending from reading the original Empire books. I’m not sure I’ll keep reading the series anymore which is sad. And I learned my lesson not to preorder a book. I missed the return window because of it. I would have definitely returned this book since I skimmed through it.

,"Is Dripping In Angst As The Couple’s Journey Comes To Its Dramatic Conclusion. There Has Been Such A Build Up To Get To The End Of This Series That It Is Hard To Believe It Is Over.

This is the final of four books in The Hunted series, which is James and Penny’s story. Their romance continues in the three book The Light to my Darkness series. See James as a teenager in the four book Empire High series (Matt’s story), which gives the backstory for the Untouchables - James, his brother Rob, and the Caldwell brothers – Mason and Matt. There are other books that are spinoffs to these books, including the Men of Manhattan series of standalones: City of Sin, Third Chances, and Missing Pieces.

The Men of Manhattan series intersects with The Hunted series. While each series can be enjoyed on its own, each book is even more enjoyable when read collectively because little glimpses of the characters from one book to another add to the depth of their individual stories. Approximating the chronological order, the two series combined should be read as follows (according to the author).

1. Temptation (James Hunter and Penny Taylor’s story, part 1)
2. Addiction (James Hunter and Penny Taylor’s story, part 2)
3. City of Sin (Mason Caldwell and Bridget Cowen’s story)
4. Eruption (James Hunter and Penny Taylor’s story, part 3)
5. Third Chances (Rob Hunter and Daphne Hughes’s story)
6. Devotion (James Hunter and Penny Taylor’s story, part 4)
7. Missing Pieces (Tyler Stevens and Hailey Shaw’s story)

And for those that want to continue reading about James and Penny Hunter, The Light to my Darkness series includes:

1. The Light to my Darkness (James and Penny Hunter, part 1)
2. A Whirlwind of Color (James and Penny Hunter, part 2)
3. This Is Love James and Penny Hunter, part 3)

The review for Devotion, book four, is below. For those that are not reading the series back-to-back, a little summary of the previous books is first included as a refresher.

FROM TEMPTATION, BOOK ONE:

As book one came to a close, James and Penny’s tumultuous relationship had fractured. It had been love at first sight for the pair that first crossed paths in a coffee shop, but the professor-student situation they found themselves in the next day had them fighting their feelings for one another. Penny dated a little, including a double date with her roommate Melissa and her new boyfriend Josh that paired Penny with her ex from last year, Austin. Then there is Tyler. He is Josh’s Sigma Pi fraternity brother and sits beside Penny in Comm 212, which is the course Professor Hunter teaches. Tyler and Penny definitely have chemistry, but for Penny, it is not quite enough to pull her past the heartbreak that Austin caused her. They become good friends, though Tyler clearly wants more. He is sweet and thoughtful, but he definitely makes a few big mistakes. What makes Tyler so forgivable is the fact that he is sincerely apologetic. If Tyler and Penny were given time, they would most likely become a couple. Unfortunately for Tyler, time is not on his side when it comes to Penny. Though Tyler may be older than Penny, as a senior he is still a child in comparison to Professor Hunter.

The heartbreak that Penny experienced last spring is all but forgotten in Professor Hunter’s presence. Eventually, neither Professor Hunter nor Penny can maintain the appropriate professor-student boundaries. This puts them both in the position of hiding their forbidden relationship from everyone – not a healthy place for a new relationship to start. But James had kept the fact that he was technically still a married man from Penny, and she struggled to trust him again once she found out. They took a break, but when they got back together and James indicated he would like her to move in with him, Penny finally shared her own secret – that she was not a senior as he had presumed, but a sophomore just turning twenty. James has a past that still remains somewhat of a mystery, but trust is an issue he struggles with himself. He ends things with Penny on the spot, sending her back to her dorm room to nurse her broken heart. By this time Penny’s secret relationship with Professor Hunter had become known to Tyler and Melissa, neither of which is pleased with Penny.

FROM PROFESSOR HUNTER:

The free bonus mini book in Professor Hunter’s POV is available via the link at the back of Temptation. It gives some insight into James. A few minor facts from Addiction are thrown in below to give a more detailed summary.

James is trying to make a change in his life, and teaching makes him happy. He misses the busy lifestyle that his NYC home has to offer, but staying was no longer an option. He needs real change. He had partied away his undergrad years at Harvard as an escape from his parents’ plans for him to marry the dreaded ice queen Isabella, the daughter of a family friend. The pair had attended high school together and he had never taken to her. He had a girlfriend in high school that his parents forced him to give up. The arrangement with Isabella was supposedly ideal since like James, Isabella came from money. The logic was that Isabella therefore wouldn’t be marrying him for his money. After college, at twenty-two, James began a tech startup, Blive Tech International, which is now a Fortune 500 publicly traded company. He then finally bit the bullet and married Isabella as planned. Despite his best efforts to turn it into a real marriage, he suspected Isabella had never been faithful to him. Things were definitely bad when he chose to sell his company last year and only keep his seat on the board. He got 2.8 billion dollars from the sale, but Isabella hadn’t wanted him to sell and become a lowly professor. Apparently she was mostly into the marriage because of the money after all.

He began teaching in New York and found that he loved it, but last December he found Isabella in their bed with the dean of admissions at his college, Jared Halloway. That was the end of his job and his marriage. He filed for divorce, and he had relocated to the University of New Castle spring semester of last year. It made him happy for a time, but he had begun to feel empty inside. James suffers from addiction. His whole life he felt pressured to be the perfect son, and he escaped the pressure by drifting from one addiction to another. His therapist wants him to work on his breathing – slow breaths – but Delaware was beginning to feel stifling until he ran into the beautiful redhead in the coffee shop on Main Street. Suddenly he could breathe again. When she showed up in his classroom he knew it was fate, and yet it was wrong. He was no good for her, but his obsession couldn’t be helped. She was a temptation he couldn’t ignore. Just as it looked like they might have something real together, though, he learned that like him, she had lied. James has difficulty trusting people, which is why he had become so isolated. The truth had shattered him.

FROM ADDICTION, BOOK TWO:

As book two opens, it is October fourteenth, the day before Penny’s birthday.

Penny Taylor, just turning twenty, is in the middle of the fall semester of her sophomore year of college at the University of New Castle in Newark, Delaware. She feels entirely alone. It seems everyone is disappointed in her. Two weeks have passed since Professor Hunter sent her away. Since then, Penny has spiraled downhill. She felt the sting of not being able to fully explain herself to James and has since let herself and her academics slip. Meanwhile, she has watched as Professor Hunter ignores her yet looks completely put together and unaffected by their breakup. Penny needs to make a change before she flunks her classes and loses her scholarship, and Melissa’s advice keeps coming back to her: the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. Penny’s birthday party is epic in so many ways. It ends in disaster, but it also opens the door for her and James to get back together. A lot went on during their two weeks apart, and much must be forgiven by the two if they are to pick back up where they left off. And there is one truth that James shares with her that makes her doubt what they have is real. James is an addict, and one might argue that Penny is his new addiction.

Once again, Penny has several men in her life vying for her attention. They all make their interest known to her. Austin makes a brief appearance again. Tyler continues to wait on the sidelines hoping his friendship with Penny will eventually lead to something more. His devotion is endearing despite the fact that his judgement is sometimes imperfect (fans shouldn’t feel too bad for Tyler; he gets his own HEA in Missing Pieces). Notably, a new man enters Penny’s life – a man that made a brief appearance in book one. Brendan, twenty-nine, is the architect that designed Professor Hunter’s ritzy apartment building. He had witnessed Penny’s half-dressed escape after she had found the wedding ring in Temptation. Here he once again catches her coming and going, and the pair begin an awkward friendship – one that involves advice as well as kisses. Like Tyler, he makes it clear what he wants, but he doesn’t mind being a friend in the meantime. As Professor Hunter and Penny try to work things out, the other men in her life aren’t too far away. And because their relationship is rocky, those men might just find Penny at a vulnerable point and swoop in to help her pick up the pieces. The angst keeps the readers on their toes! As Penny balances the three men in her life – Professor Hunter, Tyler, and Brendan – things become very complicated. As James and Penny get more serious, more characters are introduced. James’s wild and flirty brother Rob enters the story here. Mason Caldwell gets a cameo, and James’s wife Isabella is present as well. Her appearance ramps up the plot as things really begin to get serious in a variety of ways for James and Penny. As the circle that knows about James and Penny increases, so does the danger of discovery. This book is explosive when their secret comes out, and the newly engaged couple relocates to New York to get away from the controversy. They earn a happy for now ending.

FROM ERUPTION, BOOK THREE:

As the book opens it is roughly two and one half years after the couple left the University of New Castle in book two. There have been a lot of changes. James and Penny have since settled into a routine in their New York home with James running a new tech startup – Hunter Technologies – and Penny finishing her degree at NYCU. Rob Hunter frequently visits but has remained in James’s condo back in Newark where he enjoys the coed population. James sometimes hangs out with his friends – Mason, Matt, and his brother Rob. Mason and Bee are now a power couple, running their successful advertising agency together. Penny sometimes hangs out with Bee and her friends, and she continues to be very good friends with Tyler, who is building a successful career in New York. Her old roommate Melissa is now single and graduating back in Delaware; she plans on spending the summer interning in the city. Mason Caldwell has just turned thirty, and James turns thirty as well next month.

Penny, now twenty-two, isn’t good with change. She is graduating with the class of 2018 and facing a whirlwind of change that unsettles her. Despite her many applications, she has not yet landed any interviews. She took a big hit In her self-confidence as a result of the news of her affair with Professor Hunter leaking to the public, and years later it remains an issue. She is overwhelmed because she hasn’t yet found a direction that inspires her. James is determined to have her work for him at all costs, and when Penny accepts a lowly internship at Hunter Technologies, she is faced once again with talk of her not earning her position. It puts her in a negative head space. She is lost and adrift as she begins the countdown to her June 30th wedding.

Penny feels like she has lost herself in James’s world. His home, his friends, his money that pays her tuition – and now his company that she works for. She loves James dearly and his friends have become a family of sorts. That Mrs. And Mrs. Hunter have refused to meet her to this day has been a hardship on both James and Penny. His parents still like Isabella in spite of the divorce, and their attendance at the upcoming nuptials is in question.

When talk of a bachelor party comes up, James is not interested. Penny, however, encourages him to have fun with his friends. But when James ends up whisked away by his friends and taken to a Costa Rica bachelor escape on the weekend before their wedding, Bee’s strong warning begins to eat at Penny. Bee mentions something about Mason being involved in the plans and an unsavory side business he once ran. Between James’s history with addiction, the stupid antics Rob tends to pull James into, Mason’s involvement, and Penny’s inability to reach her fiancé, the weekend begins to drag. To top it all off, a mystery person begins to leave packages for her that threaten to blow up her engagement. As the relationships around her begin to crumble and she finds herself entirely alone, Penny is faced with a crisis. Isabella makes some bold claims, and James’s ex-girlfriend Rachel enters the picture. James has some explaining to do, but then again so does Penny.. Their story takes a devastating twist and ends in a cliffhanger.

FROM DEVOTION, BOOK FOUR:

Fans may choose to read Third Chances from the Men of Manhattan series prior to reading this book. Glimpses of James during his bachelor party weekend in Costa Rica are seen through Rob and Daphne’s POVs.

As the last book closed, James and Penny had each kept some important developments close to the vest since his return from Costa Rica late Sunday night. Someone had been spying on them and sending threats as well as pictures and letters meant to turn them against one another. Penny is convinced Isabella is behind it all, but James has unfortunately fallen for Isabella’s ploy. The couple’s communication had broken down. Stress and emotions as their wedding day approach may have played a role. Avoidance and wishful thinking likely play a role as well. For James, his need to control things justifies not letting Penny in. Regardless, their lack of communication leads to a major meltdown and a breach of trust – far worse than the issues they ignored. Drunk and heartbroken over the $20 million Penny had transferred to Tyler’s bank account, James refuses believe her explanations and berates her verbally before kicking her to the curb once and for all. Penny worries that James may fall into bad habits in her absence and enlists Rob, Mason, and Ian to watch over him. She also seeks out his parents to confide her concerns to them. Rob finds Penny and takes her back to Delaware for the night, but when morning arrives and James has still not responded to her calls and texts, she plans to leave town per his demands.

This book picks up seamlessly where book three left off. It is early Friday morning, the day before James and Penny are scheduled to be married. Tyler unfortunately gets caught up in the drama, which leads to some heartbreak. Just as Penny is ready to head to the airport and begin anew in Chicago, James makes an appearance. The broken pair are overwhelmed by their desire to make amends, yet both still hold a great deal of anger inside. They finally have the heart to heart that they should have had on Monday morning. James had not canceled the wedding, so they agree to move forward as scheduled. James worries that Isabella will stop at nothing to keep him and Penny apart, and he tightens his security to ensure she is kept at bay. The rehearsal dinner takes place that evening, and there are a few surprises in store for them. The threat of danger becomes real the next day, the day of the wedding. Someone continues to target the couple, but the case is not easily solved. James and Penny face their biggest struggle yet, and their friends pull together to help them through it. This is the final story in this series. James and Penny earn a very well-deserved happy ending.

Tyler Stevens, Penny’s good friend from college, has his own story that spins off from this book. He also comes up in the epilogue of Third Chances as that series segues into Tyler’s HEA. He hasn’t always been painted as the good guy, but it is mostly just that he is human and makes some dumb mistakes (and judging his actions while he is under the influence is probably not entirely fair). After years of not getting over Penny, his story has become very sympathetic. His story is found in Missing Pieces, book three of the Men of Manhattan series..

Note also that the three book series The Light to my Darkness is James and Penny’s second series and a continuation of their story.

Wow! There has been such a build up to get to the end of this series that it is hard to believe it is over. It exciting to know that another series provides a peak at James and Penny’s lives in the future; thus it is not as sad to get to the end as it might be otherwise. This final book is full of drama, but it is great to finally see some resolution. James and Penny repeat some old dysfunctional patterns but appear to work things out and put things into context. The drama with his parents and Isabella Is messy and complicated, to say the least. Tyler and Melissa’s relationship with Penny had become complicated in Eruption, and things continue to be off here. The book does a good job of bringing in friends and family, showing several couples coming together to celebrate. Be prepared for some shocking surprises!

Fans of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy will enjoy elements of this story that feel familiar. Penny is sometimes maddening in her decision-making here. The book takes place over a very brief period of time, and as the story is told entirely in Penny’s POV, the reader gets to follow along as she vacillates between choices. It sometimes feels tedious, but it is also very real. She is reserved and not quick to make decisions, so the reader experiences her wavering emotions.

James and Penny’s steamy romantic suspense is dripping in angst as the couple’s journey comes to its dramatic conclusion! James and Penny’s story opens as they meet at the beginning of her sophomore year of college. As Professor Hunter, James is taboo but that doesn’t deter Penny from pursuing him. He tries to do the right thing, but she doesn’t make it easy. As they make their home in New York years later and their wedding day approaches, Penny feels overwhelmed by the changes she faces, and a bachelor weekend away opens the door for a crack in their relationship. Ultimately everything explodes when someone begins to threaten them, leading to the exciting conclusion of the series. This story is nicely written. The plot is somewhat complex. The story is written in first person in Penny’s POV. I rate this book four stars.",Kaylea Sims," July 23, 2015",5.0,dp

,"This is the 4th and final book in The Hunted Series.
Tick tock. One day before the wedding of her dreams, Penny is in a city that is no longer her home. Alone. Heartbroken. Lost. Could the past few years really mean so little to a man that became her world? To a man she’d do anything to protect? There is no future without him. There is no her without him.
With only 24 hours until the wedding, is there enough time to repair the damage? Tick tock.
And even if Penny and James do come back to each other, Isabella is still out there plotting. The world is still against them. Darkness still lurks in the shadows of James’ past. A student and her professor were never meant to be forever. They thought it was an everlasting love, but it was doomed from the very start. Tick tock.
Temptation led to addiction, which exploded into an eruption of chaos. And when the pieces settled, only one thing became clear…devotion. One great love. A love worth fighting for. Because the only thing that lasts forever is love.
This book was absolutely fantastic. The whole series has had me absolutely gripped.
This book was a roller-coaster of a ride. It hit all of the feels. I absolutely love James. He is an absolutely fantastic character. I love his backstory, and I love how his character has developed. Penny has been fantastic as well. Seeing their relationship grow and develop was absolutely brilliant. I love them.
All of the other characters were brilliant as well. We really get to know them. Melissa and Rob were firm favourites for me.
This book had it all. The wedding was brilliant, and then everything went to hell. Oh god, Isabella is a complete phycho. Things just kept happening. There was a constant stream of twists and turns, which had me absolutely glued to this book.
The ending was brilliant. Penny and James deserved their happy ending. I absolutely love James, and after everything he’s been through, I was so glad with how things turned out for him.
I just absolutely loved this whole series. Everything was absolutely brilliant. I would definitely recommend this series.

LOVED THIS SERIES!,"I wanted to enjoy the series, and the first book had me hooked. The two main characters are drawn well, and their meet cute was... well, cute.

Unfortunately the second book turned out to be filler. Whereas the crisp dialogue and quick bloom of romance was novel and charming in the first book, the boudoir repartee stayed the same - right down to each saying the same sweet nothings while having sex the same way as every other time. This made the sex scenes repetitious and cliché. We also had to endure the recurring Does he/Doesn't he love me internal dialogue of a girl clearly too emotionally immature for marriage.

The writer has no ken of security. Round-the-clock protection would require a rotating cadre of eight, not the two. And security chief Porter's activities were inconsistent, allowing her to override his main objective of protecting her. Releasing her to go up by herself after repeatedly insisting he was not to leave her out of his sight? Confusing. Inconsistent.

Also, the subplot with the lifelong seasoned security pro was ridiculous. The notion that a civilian can get off three shots to zero over a 'best of the best' security guard fatuous. And agents protect their families and also recognize the risks they assume when they are on protection detail. Most are single for that reason, but even if not, a family's location remain top secret from all except the security firm. And providing amnesty just because of the threat? I think not. Try kidnapping, accessory to murder after the fact, wrongful imprisonment, assault with a deadly weapon, blah blah. He'd be in Sing Sing regardless how justifiable his 'reasons.'

Also, the idea of a multibillionaire sitting down at a police station becoming frustrated with the surly detective on duty is utter ridiculousness. Sure, that’s the way it works with peons but James Hunter was a billionaire. In real life, Hunter would have called his extraordinarily high priced and ultra-powerful attorney to call his pal the district attorney and golfing buddy, the mayor who would then call the chief of police. The municipality would have rolled out the red carpet and he’d be speaking with the chief of police immediately. And any foolish detective that insulted him would see traffic detail for six months if he wasn’t canned.

The story with the ever-elusive Isabella was convoluted and quickly became tiresome. What, did she train in the CIA after coming out at her Debutante Ball? Her episodic attacks while remaining invisible, her supposed 'hacking' a phone using a microlight transmitter sticky are technically impossible because of the antenna requirement (as anyone who remembers the iPhone 8 antenna debacle can attest.) As were many other aspects of her harassment.

Also, financial transactions don’t proceed that way, and the bank would not worry about her threat to pull her money. Financial institutions would much rather have a single client pull their business then to have to deal with the proctology exam and subsequent fine by FINancial Crimes ENforcement because they allowed an unknown customer to wire millions without filling out paperwork. The transaction would flag the IRS and bring in Justice Dept/FINCEN, the FBI, and also possibly the US Secret Service who would worry about money laundering. No bank wants to endure the government's financial speculum when the alternative is to lose a single client.

Overall the entire series was riddled with inaccuracies. The charming dialogue from the meet cute of the first book was enjoyable. I wanted to be a fan. Unfortunately, the series is a book and a half too long, during which time Penny's simpering internal dialogue and the factual inaccuracies became plodding and pendulous.",Reed," August 27, 2014",4.0,dp
,"Imagine the cheesiest most poorly written tv show ever written, yet you still watch it! You wanna know why? Drama! This series is so badly written! But you are kept hooked with all the drama! The things that happen in these books are quick and then over just as quick! Comical really! Like how penny and professor didn't talk for two weeks and both slept with other people then bam they are ok and penny becomes bff with the guy and James is magically ok with it and then right before the wedding its kinda called off and Tyler confuses his undying love again even though he and penny where bff and he was actually living with and dating g penny's female bff! Yeah like I said drama lol Penny is still very immature so is the professor! Now they are having a baby!

Penny just walks out gives Ivan her key cards and credit card then tells Ivan should give them too James but too watch out for him and take care of him. Ivan is shocked and wants too drive Penny anywhere but she refuses. Penny starts walking and walking tears stream down it's raining but she doesn't care. She's lost the only man she'll ever love, why wouldn't he trust her word over Isabellas lies? Penny walks and walks doesn't care that she's soaking wet her life is over and she's numb. But she's tells herself she's not weak and decides to leave get a ticket to somewhere and try to start over. But she's not forgotten by Tyler or Rob who come too convince her to go away with him, but one wants her to stay and marry James, telling her that James loves her and is falling apart without her, but Penny isn't convinced will she cave?",Anne E.," November 21, 2013",4.0,dp
,"Series review:
Wonderful series however there are 2 ways to read the series, by series or chronological. According to the website you should read it by series first and then the second time you read it the author has a chronological reading order. After reading this series there are lots of time jumps that are not well explained and theres new characters that have relationships and a lot of background happens without any explanation in this series because the author explains it (im assuming) in another series. I would suggest to just read it in the chronological order.

Overall the characters are interesting and the plot was very interesting but I think it would have been better to read it chronologically to understand more of the nuance.",Strawberry Kisses," September 3, 2013",4.0,dp
Ugh!,"This book was so good, except pretty steamy for my taste, but this is book 4 in series, so...guess I'm getting used to it. It's been a very good storyline with lots of lust, love & laughs.",Lily C," September 4, 2013",4.0,dp
,"If you're going to read just one book in the entire series, this would be the one to read. It has enough emotion, danger, and mystery to satisfy the most demanding readers among us. Gone are the teen angst (thank goodness!), Penny is finally starting to think and act like an adult which makes this a much more enjoyable to read than the other books in this series. The HEA is nice. I don't think another book in the series is appropriate, it feels like too much, a simple epilogue would have suited much better. I won't be reading the next book. The description has James going backwards with the ""addiction"" theme, which by the way, as a medical professional, I saw no evidence of any addiction in his behavior as it was written so the addiction angle was hard to swallow. Anyway, the next book in the series seems to have the couple regressing when this book had put it all to rest quite nicely. What would be the point of regression if not to just get one more book out of the series? That's a poor excuse and the reason why I am choosing to stop here. Here is where the series should be ending, with an epilogue.",D'Ann," October 31, 2015",4.0,dp

Amazing,"The series felt personal and earnest. I can't say that I wasn't yelling at my kindle. I was completely floored at some of the aftermath of behavior with Penny. I know she struggled and was young, full of self doubt. However, she drove me nuts with her \ their abilities to continuously keep things from each other, even upon the the ending. Yes, I was already devoted to these characters and their future, but I still felt Penny was still young and immature during the last moments of the series. I was hoping for a bigger transition of growth for her. Even in her eyes James grew, but unfortunately I did not see the major growth for her, in spite of them being in a relationship spanning over years. What kind of shyt is that when the guy grows and she is still young and dumb? (Sidebar : the use of sexy was annoying as f$&%, throughout the series. Yes I read it all.

,"I’ve been off of standard romances for a while but somehow I started this series. It was a good read and the chemistry between the character is HOT! I kept reading through the books bc I was in a book funk but the style really wasn’t my thing....until I got to this book. Oh my goodness, was this a page turner. All of a sudden there’s mystery and suspense and action. I loved it! I wish I had a bit more of a look into the master mind planning of it all. It was a “tied up with a bow” type explanation. But to be fair, I always want to get into the mind of the bad guy, to see things play out on that end and this book is written from Pennys perspective. That’s why it still got 5 stars instead of 4....(I was feeling like I wanted to know more but that wasn’t the authors fault. The perspective has been in place the entire series).

She brought a new meaning to being stuck up. I loved Robs
character he was so animated and brought a lot of fun and humor to the storyline. I really felt bad for Tyler but was so glad that he was able to move on.

Amazing!,"REVIEW BY THE ARC TEAM OF IVY SMOAK...First if you haven read The Hunted; Series you should start....Now about DEVOTION: grab a box of tissues and a drink, then some snacks cause you will not put the book down till you finish the whole thing...What can I say accept it will keep you on the edge of your seat,, you will cry, laugh and be angry, cause there are so many emotions involved in this book...Penny and James grow so much in this book., In all the books you see the mistakes they make through Temtation then Addiction gets in the way, which finally explodes iinto Eruption, but it will all come together in Devotion...You also get to see a glimpse of them in City of Sin. Then Third chances you hear alot of Jame insecurities,; he holds the weight of the world; on his shoulders for Penny and everyone else ...Ivy has outdone herself with this book...The way she wrote about these characters throughout the series will not even compare to how she brings them together In Devotion ..There are times when you can lean on others, you are not alone. We are all here for you. Family is more then blood deep. Ivy shows that in this book...So get your copy today and don't wait....Ivy I would give it 10 stars if it was possible...Thanks again for one of the best series I have ever read,.

But the passion between Penny and James is everything! These two are both a hot mess but just so perfect for each other. I felt everything in this book!

This book had my heart racing and felt more like a thriller. It was a little overly dramatic and intense but I thought it kept things twisty!! This whole series gave me some major fifty shades vibes which totally was okay.

I got way too emotionally invested in Peggy and James's relationship. I read all 4 books in 2 days...but I think it's pretty hard not too! I thought the end was perfect too.

"Read for the sex, not the content.","The author can write a sentence fairly well, and the love scenes were decent, but other than that, there’s nothing here. The main characters never have any conversations that aren’t some version of, “ I need you, why don’t you believe me, no you’re NOT addicted to me, this is LOVE!” It’s sooo monotonously angst-y, that it just got boring. It’s a one note love story until about halfway through... and then (spoiler alert) all of a sudden it’s a poorly plotted murder mystery? Honestly, that part didn’t even make sense. All of a sudden, after two years of opportunity, the ex decides to start messing with the main characters again? The whole thing was just really poorly done.
These books need a.) a much better editor, b.) focus, and c.) an author who knows her craft a little better. They could also benefit from a little research. I’d honestly believe the whole “addict” aspect came from a single google search, and don’t even get me started on the timing of Penny’s pregnancy. How on earth was Penny “about 4 weeks” when the first two weeks are counted from the time of your period, and the next two weeks her husband was in a coma? Were the vague symptoms alluded to prior to the wedding just for fun? It makes zero sense. The fact that she did zero medical research for this story was pretty apparent. Oh, let me just have my husband’s surgeon/ICU doc tack on a random ultrasound for someone who isn’t even a patient. Sure buddy. That’s about as believable as doctors ambulating patients themselves. I honestly don’t know why I’ve read this far into the series, other than the fact that the sex scenes are pretty hot. So yeah.

I had to go off and read another book. I was tired with all their problems. By the time I read book 3 it felt like some of the characters were more like cartoon characters - way over the top. Isabella is like Cruella Deville from 101 Dalmatians and the mother not far behind. Then I had to take a bigger break from the story as their problems got tedious. By the fourth book I felt like I was watching a ping pong match with as much speed -bad thing happens, resolved, bad, resolution, bad, resolution -- tiresome so you can't wait for the story to be done. Not into reading anything more about these character or their minor characters.",Kindle Customer," September 14, 2013",5.0,dp

,"Let me first start by saying I normally don't read student/teacher books but the first book was free and I was hooked after that. The characters are well thought out but still reflected real life attributes. Eeample: Penny's hesitance to pick between Tyler and James. As a person who hates making decisions out of fear of making the wrong one I related to that.

The book starts right where the previous one ends so theres no waiting or guessing for the reader. Its no secret that at the start of this book Penny and James are not in a good place. There was still love, humor and drama but Penny's internal dialog really stood out.

I love how as the books progressed you really saw the characters, mostly Penny, mature and grow. James also surprised me with his willingness to open up in this book. He's usually the strong protective type but certain events forced him to be vulnerable.

If I had to say something negative it would be; I wish we got some of James internal dialog.",Kim Lackey," June 24, 2023",5.0,dp
Holy craziness,"This series is a fast read only because you will read all day and though the night. I appreciate the way penny and James' relationship is written mostly because, while there is angst in the relationship, they do not disrespect each other or each other's bodies. Thank you for that Ivy. It's refreshing to read a psychological thriller where a couple may have their struggles, but still love selflessly. Excited to read more about this couple in the future bc face it, once you read this you will. No. Get. Enough. Of penny & James.
I also went ahead and took the liberty of creating my own playlist to this series if it was available:

I HATE HATE HATE books that every male in the book has to repeatedly tell the main character how beautiful she is. EVERY man in the book wanted her. Give me a break already! Penny was ALWAYS crying, needing sex, playing the victim, and finding ways to blame James for everything. If it rained it was James's fault. James stops talking to her for 2 weeks and she's in the bed with someone else. She was so immature. She basically used Tyler. I actually kind of liked James, which is why I gave this book 2 stars The addiction storyline was weak. I'm not sure why the author added that to the book to be honest.

,"I have been studying Balkan history for many years now and this book was defenitely the most well-balanced and complete work I have ever read about the region. It's extremely detailed, but never boring. The author experienced Montenegro not only through reports and interviews with decisionmakers, but also by meeting ordinary people and hearing their stories. This makes the book not'just another summary of political events, but a fascinating story about a country evolving.

This book describes the long road that led to the disintegration of the small Balkan Republic of Montenegro from Serbia in the 1990-ies and onwards. The case of Montenegro is exceptional in many ways. The history of the country is extremely disputed. Historical data are always biased by political circumstances. But the author manages to distinguish myth and reality very well. He always finds the story behind the story. He describes political events in the light of ancients tribal divisions and modern events (the wars of the 20th centruy, the privatisation process). Modern and ancient forces in society are blended into a very exciting, yet very scientific story.

I stronlgy recommend decisionmakers or anyone else involved in the South-western Balkans, to read this, before acting or judging.",Blue Jay," November 17, 2021",3.0,dp

Quirky Black Comedy Bergman Satire,"Lo siento pero es un libro horrible.

,"Dusan Makavejev's Montenegro is not you typical film. In fact, it is one of the strangest films that I've come across in quite awhile. This is not to say that its not a good film. It may even be a great film.

The story follows Marilyn Jordon (Susan Anspach) over several days leading up to New Years in Sweden. Marilyn is a bored housewife who seemingly has it all but is going slowly insane. Married to Bergman regular Erland Josephson she is the victim of a loveless marriage and a very stratified social circle.

One holiday season she is detained at the airport while on her way to join her husband on a business trip and falls in with a group of Yugoslavian immigrants led by Alex Rossignol (Bora Todorovic) and her already shaky life begins to truly unravel.

The immigrants are everything she is not. They are lustful (horny would probably be a better description) and fun loving. They run an earthy night club called the Zanzibar where just about anything can happen. Marilyn begins to experience life again with a lover, a zoo-keeper named Montenegro (Svetozar Cvetkovic). The problem is that this life can't go on forever and she must return to her family with some outrageous results.

This is black comedy at its finest. It is a pointed satire of Bergman's work that even includes some familiar Bergman faces. The disc is out of print now but with some looking can be easily found. The Fox Lorber transfer is adequate despite some rather severe letterboxing. Look for a fine performance by Anspach and a dance by unknown Patricia Gelin with a tank that makes the whole quirky movie worthwhile.

Did not work,"This is an absurdist tale. Things that are really strange are happening, but they make their own sense in the situation and become believable.

Here's the scoop. Susan Anspach is an American expatriate married to an older Swedish man. They have a younger boy and girl and dad's 84 year old father is a nut-case who is trying to find a mail order bride. Susan is slipping into madness. She tries to poison the dog. She sees bugs where there are none. And eats an entire meal she has cooked for the family. While trying to accompany her hubby on a business trip they get separated at the airport and she ends up at the ""Zanzi-Bar"" with a bunch of Russian(?) gypsies, and a real wild ride ensues.

This is one weird flick. Her husband is on the cold side and maybe gay. Grandpa's around the bend. She's holding on by her fingernails as she runs into a group of people that up-end her entire sense of civility and decorum. People fighting with shovels, people stabbing relatives in the head for cheating at cards and having sex in the open are all way contrary to anything she's ever experienced. But she finds a certain sense of liberation in it. She gets to like it and even joins in, as a singer, during the night's entertainment. She does finally see the absurdity in it all and heads home to a disastrous conclusion.

This, as odd as it is, is supposedly based on a true story. It's shot in a rather plain fashion but the images speak for themselves. The arresting quality here is that you can't believe what you're seeing. And the director reminds us, through constant shots of various animals, what we really are underneath it all. The music is a mixed bag ranging from pop, to cabaret to orchestrated pieces.

This is a great, oddball flick with a dash of eroticism to it. If weird is your poison, have at it.",Roberto Frangie," November 16, 2022",5.0,dp
,"First saw this in 1981 when it came out and was struck by how clever it was psychologically and philosophically. It is a tasteful erotic art piece which can be looked at over and over with a beautiful soundtrack and cinematography. Loveless repression is the stuff madness and unbridled inhibition is made of. Freud discussed these cases all the time. The kind of life that causes one to act out. Well Susan Anspach (who is terribly attractive in this film) a prim and proper upper class Scandinavian gets enmeshed with a wild and crazy group of gypsies for a few days. Who is crazy?....well just about everyone. Yet each is normal in their own socioeconomic life. Well hold onto your mind, as Susan acts out brilliantly if not in a matter of fact manner. I mean she handles bizarre scenarios as if they were normal to her. She seamlessly slips between her prim and proper Upper class lifestyle and the crass bohemian lifestyle. But not without a deadly price to the people in both worlds. A brilliant dark comedy; and trust me there is not a sane person in the cast. Now it's hard to find at a good price. Fortunately on eBay you can find an Australian import put out by BPS video services from 2012 for 19.95. It is not a bootleg; it is a professional reproduction service of rare and hard to find movies.",Steve P," December 4, 2021",5.0,dp
The tank!,"It is funny, very erotic, passionate, and riddled with jabs into society's snobbish attitude toward sexual fulfillment...

A very wealthy American woman is married to a dull Swedish businessman... When the husband is about to leave for Brazil, she decides to go along with him, but is held up in customs and misses the plane... Trying to get back home, she is caught up in the life-style of a group of vibrant Yugoslavian immigrants living in Sweden... She falls in love with the peculiar manners of the group and decides to stay for a couple of days, ending up in a romantic affair with one of the workers, singing in a topless bar, and having a lot of fun...

In contrast to Makavejev's other noteworthy films, ""WR--Mysteries of the Organism"" and ""Sweet Movie,"" ""Montenegro"" is light and uncomplicated... It's a simple story simply told... The message is the same--sexual repression leads to insanity, but sensual indulgence livens the spirit...

""Montenegro"" does not exploit its eroticism; it lets it grow out of the situation, out of the characters... When Susan Anspach is seen taking a shower, it is photographed in a very beautiful, soft manner... When a couple is making love, the camera pans up their reeling bodies only long enough to establish their lovemaking, then moves on...",," January 25, 2022",5.0,dp

Bergman meets Bunuel,"I went to see this movie on Christmas night of 1981, not knowing what to expect. Few movies can thrill on first viewing the way this one did--I think of ""Law of Desire"" as one such movie and it is also dark, erotic and as visually stunning as Montenegro. What struck me was the Bergman beginning and the Bunuel/Almodovar end. The movie begins in the sterile (and of course Scandanavian) background of Bergman. Clean, sterile and boring except for Susan Anspach's constant fondling of her luxurious fur coat. Then, with the sudden appearance of a black taxi driver in the white background of Sweden, one is driven to an incredible,almost unbelievable compound of gypsies who live amorally and happily--if not hysterically--in Zanzibar. Here Montenegro appears, who was first seen in the Bergman portion working in a zoo. So now, is this a dream or is it live--and where did the detour begin? Ask yourself that when you think over the film--and you will think it over many times. The dream like sequence is pure Bunuel--or even Almadovar as his wittiest, and complete with some of the most beautiful nudity and sex ever captured on screen. The movie returns to Bergman, somewhere along the way--or does it? Are we still dreaming at the end? Even though the story is based on a true event, this interpretation of the real-life story is the only way to escape such a sad conclusion. This is the flip-side of the film ""Star 80"" in which Fosse grabbed us by the neck and shoved our faces into the true results of a gruesome murder, which is usually so clean and tidy in other films. In Montenegro, even without knowing the details of the true story, we approach the nightmare and its antecedents and we can only imagine that we too are dreaming until we awaken. This film, like ""Law of Desire"" is lush to look at, seductive to watch and will be very difficult to remove, if ever, from your memory. Enjoy without guilt.",Dr. Alan D. Kardoff," November 12, 2021",5.0,dp
,"The movie begins with a family that seems to be duller than Dagwood & Blonde. Everyone seems safe. But Anspach, the lovely wife has a lust and yearning for excitement or at least a change of pace. She meets a neat guy who is part of gypsy clan. Somehow she wanders away from home and gets into a group of gypsies. The man's name is Montenegro. The vagabonds live a carefree life of abandon. Lots of love, lust and some women dancing in the buff for their own joy and group satisfaction. Anspach ""tries"" to resist Montenegro and their passion sizzles the screen. She adapts to the new life and seems more in it than to be a part of a family with a cockhold (dullard) of a husband. The end puzzled me in a way. Does she return for good or?
I found the movie much more lively and enjoyable than the reviews. At the same time, this is NOT porn. The movie shows contrasting cultures (staid vs gypsy) and Anspach won my heart as well as admiration for her beauty and acting. I note a new version is coming out. The 81 edition is excellent. I am reluctant to part with this VHS. It is worth watching two-four times at intervals and when in different moods. Each time one comes away livelier and also seeing new perspectives.

Delightful but different. R and Lively. Anspach superb.,"I really don't like doing the whole, ""Not many people will understand this,"" vein, but this movie really isn't for everybody. I personally got so much from it from my first viewing, and yet I got the strange feeling that no one else in the theatre I was in really quite ""got it"", so to speak. A lot of them laughed heartily, but they seemed to laugh at the apparent ""randomness"" of it, but none of it was random at all. This is a very precise and firmly crafted piece of postmodern art.

First of all, the climax is somewhat in the beginning when she says ""I hate being in this movie!"" and the very beginning is really the last shot. A lot of situations that incited laughter only did so after the punchline had already been given moments beforehand. A lot of this film is circuitous and self-reflexive, and everything breaks down so that any given meaning something may have eventually undermines itself later. The thing that's excellent about it is how precise and organized it is at breaking everything down into structureless structure. The acting is great but unnecessary because the characters just say what they're thinking/feeling/etc. The story is of a bourgeois woman who falls in love with a man from a lower class and lives happily ever after... only not really. Montenegro is a character only he's one of the most incidental and least important. The children are the caretakers. The adults are the adolescents. And so on...

This film gets a lot of laughs from its irony, but mostly it's a very tense film to try to watch, and I would have MUCH preferred watching it in private so that I wouldn't feel the tension mounting in the auditorium as people literally strained to try to make sense of it. So by all means, believe my intentions are good when I say this film is not for everybody.

,"Professional reviewers seem to have missed the obvious; Montenegro is an amusing parody of Ingmar Bergman movies. It mixes Bergman's combination of intellectual and vulgar comedy with the usual ambiguities: from beginning to end, one is never sure whether the heroine (Susan Anspach in her best role) is merely a bored housewife or dangerously insane. Similarly, one can't be sure whether the world of Yugoslavian immigrants that she enters is safer or more dangerous than her normal life. The real key is found when it becomes obvious that the psychiatrist (hired by her husband) is more clearly disturbed than any potential patient. If you're tired of Woody Allen takeoffs on Bergman, see Montenegro.",Ankur Mukherjee," November 12, 2021",5.0,dp
An exercise in postmodernism,"A truely honest film with charecters honest to themselves, honest and genuine. We witness some really interesting people here and they easily grab your attention, no matter what, they seem to share so many things with us at a time. The film oozes with decent performances, decent acting and direction. Susan Anspach is very amusing, delivers a very sattisfying performance so did the others. She is hot, she is innocent, she is honest, she is a totally genuine housewife who is honest to herself and with you too. One thing the film will always tell you ia that always listen to your heart.",MattInLAX," November 12, 2021",5.0,dp
,"It's too bad Susan Anspach never became an international star. Her performance here is rich and detailed and full of subtlety. Many do not realize that this movie was based on a real life ex-Patriot wife who did poison her european family after being so fed up with her life and her uninvolved husband. There is some raw eroticism here (that was typical of the edgier filmmaking of the time) but it is surely not pornographic. The comedic situations in the film are dark and dry. I first watched it when it was in theatres and went back twice. I've watched it again through the years, and it still holds up. Mid-life crisis or not, I think anyone can relate to wanting to not just live life, but to feel it full force. The soundtrack includes the wonderful ""Ballad of Lucy Jordan,"" by Marianne Faithful.",DANIEL J. ANTIL," November 12, 2021",5.0,dp
Generally ignored satire of Ingmar Bergman movies,"This is one of those movies that treads the thin line between softcore porn and legitimate comedy/drama. I only say that, because the few times I've watched it was on an adult cable channel. I think it's the latter. While it does have a good deal of sexual content (tastefully done), it's more interesting as a story. It's a wonderful tale of a bored housewife and her journey of discovery. A perfect blend of comedy, drama, farce, pathos, and erotica. In Dutch with English subtitles. (Stay away from the dubbed version.)",Robert M. Yuna," November 12, 2021",5.0,dp
,"To this day, one of the oddest, quirkiest and sexiest mainstream movies ever made. Susan Anspach comes apart right before our eyes and we love it. The shrink, the kids, the hapless husband.

A Mountain Goat in Wolfe’s Clothing,"This DVD is a good quality one. Shipping was prompt.

,"Pros: It has some very interesting scenes, including some that are very funny, like Wolfe hiking through the mountains like a 300-pound goat. Also, this book gives us a lot of Wolfe’s back-story. Although this book is darker than most in the series, we still have some of Archie’s unique observations to savor. For example, referring to Wolfe’s imperious behavior, he says, “You may also wonder why I didn’t resent it. I did. I had been resenting it for years, but that was my first crack at resenting it in the mountains of Montenegro.” We get a glimpse of Wolfe’s loyalty, as both his best friend and adopted daughter are murdered. Cons: The ending was weak. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn’t recommend it until you’ve read others in the series.",ealovitt," November 12, 2021",5.0,dp
A unique Nero Wolfe Mystery,"If you have read all the books so far,I’m sure you will find the Black Mountain to be the most exciting, and physical of all the books in this series!",Granny Beth," April 12, 2022",5.0,dp
,"I never would have guessed I'd be reading mysteries starring two male chauvinist detectives, one pompous, the other cocky. However, I love the Nero Wolfe mysteries by Rex Stout and have read all of them at least twice. My husband and I also like to curl up in front of one of the excellent A&E Nero Wolfe DVDs starring Timothy Hutton and Maury Chaykin.

The earliest mysteries are the best in my opinion. All are good, but when one of Archie's 1960s girlfriends conjugates the German verb 'ficken' in public, it made me long for the good old days back in the '30s and '40s when ladies wore hats and gloves, even on a quick trip down to the neighborhood drugstore to purchase a bottle of cyanide.

""The Black Mountain"" (1954) takes Nero Wolfe and his assistant, Archie Goodwin out of their old brownstone in the heart of New York City, and into the wilds of post-war Yugoslavia on a journey of revenge. Mr. Wolfe's favorite restaurateur has been murdered and he vows to track down the assassin, even if it means leaving his home, his cook, and his vast collection of orchids.

And that is my problem with this novel. Nero Wolfe belongs in New York, even more so than Sherlock Holmes belonged in London. A large part of the charm of this series involves the comforts of Wolfe's over-sized chair, his tarpaulin-sized yellow pajamas, Fritz's plentiful, well-cooked meals, the sulky but gorgeous orchids, and Wolfe's refusal to vary his daily routine over the mere murder of one of his clients. And once in Yugoslavia, the normally self-assured Archie is completely out of his environment. He doesn't even speak the language, and his boss has to interpret everything for him. There are no babes, no baseball games, and none of the usual bickering with NYC's homicide squad to keep him happy and productive. Much of this novel is spent on the physical hardships the two detectives have to endure, the sleazy politics of communism, and Rex Stout's overwrought bursts of patriotism, e.g. Nero Wolfe's recital of the Preamble to the Constitution as he and Archie are working themselves out of a jam on the slopes of the Black Mountain.

We do get to see Wolfe's birthplace in Montenegro, and the mountainside where he herded goats, not far from the border with Albania, but I was longing for a taste of Fritz's corn fritters and all the comforts of home.",Kindle Customer," November 21, 2021",5.0,dp
My least favorite Nero Wolfe,"I first read this as a teenager. It fascinated me because of Montenegro, which means the black mountain. I was a teenager in the 1950’s and Yugoslavia included Montenegro. I was interested in the Balkans initially because I love Ancient Greek history. The whole area has a fascinating history. Nero Wolfe’s connection with it drew me in. It was still as good the second time I read it.",illiandantic," October 27, 2022",5.0,dp
,"Wolfe's close friend, Marko Vukcic, is gunned down in front of his house, and Wolfe is determined to bring the killer to justice. Weeks are spent on the investigation, but Wolfe finally finds the killer is to be found somewhere in the Balkans. Therefore, the only course is for Wolfe and Archie to go to Montenegro. This is absolutely never heard of activity for Wolfe. The activities they engage in are amazing, and is a great read. Of course Wolfe ultimately finds the actual killer and brings him to justice, but there are thrilling adventures for them before they are able to accomplish that. I highly recommend this book.",JM Harvey," August 7, 2022",5.0,dp
Nero Wolfe in Montenegro,"Rex Stout's ""The Black Mountain"" (first published in 1954) is the 24th book in his ""Nero Wolfe"" series. By this point in the series, you know pretty much what to expect. There are a couple of loops thrown at us, though, which I found particularly amusing. First, almost all of this book takes place with Nero Wolfe actually AWAY from home. And, second, because of the story's venue, there's a neat role reversal between Archie and Nero Wolfe. Unfortunately, the one thing causing me to drop my rating a star is the triteness of how the mystery is ""solved."" That's somewhat mitigated by Wolfe's insistence on justice in the proper venue instead of a local solution. But, still, it was a bit of a letdown. So, I'm rating the book at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.",Shakepen," June 3, 2022",5.0,dp
,"This isn't one of my favorite Wolfe books since we lose Marko, who wasn't a main character in the series but he helped humanize Wolfe since he seemed to be Wolfe's only friend, we also spend a great deal of time outside of the environs of the brownstone, far from Cramer and Saul, Fritz and the Orchids. That said it's still a good read and we do get to see Wolfe exert himself more than any other books other than the Zeck trilogy. Archie and Wolfe make this a fun read, but it's darker than many of the other books. Still it's well worth the time to read it...and reread it. Stout was a master.",B. R. Paschen," November 16, 2021",5.0,dp
One of my favorites,"This novel has structural problems. The Nero Wolf series is interesting because 1) Nero Wolf is an eccentric, who is able to behave as he wishes toward everyone. 2) The interaction between Wolf and his long-suffering fellow detective, secretary, and general factotum, Archie Goodwin, is an interesting relationship. 3) The setting is interesting. The old brownstone with its 10,000 orchids, all male inhabitants, overseen by the eccentric Wolf, is unique. This novel is not a detective novel: it is a revenge tale. In consequence, there is not much detection going on. It becomes more like a spy novel, and if this novel is any indication, a genre that Stout should avoid.

The Black Mountain has none of these characteristics. By setting the novel in the defunct country of Yugoslavia, Archie Goodwin is effectively silenced since he cannot speak the language, and so the relationship between Wolf and Goodwin is effectively muted. This novel is not a detective novel: it is a revenge tale. In consequence, there is not much detection going on. It becomes more like a spy novel, and if this novel is any indication, a genre that Stout should avoid.
Because Wolf needs others to carry out his revenge, he cannot be the eccentric diva that demands everyone follow his demands. He needs the help of others, which puts him in the position of changing his personality.

Stout attempts to gloss over both the setting and the structural handicaps he has given himself as a writer by making the terrain difficult and detailing Wolf's many physical discomforts. Unfortunately, these distractions don't work. But, then, it is a Nero Wolf mystery, which redeems a rather pedestrian novel.",Kindle Customer," November 14, 2021",5.0,dp

A Pivotal Story,I was reading another book and ran in to this one. I don't know much about it. I just finished reading it,Delamaine," March 22, 2022",5.0,dp
,"This is another one of the ""must-haves"" or ""must-reads"" if one is a fan or Archie Goodwin & Nero Wolfe stories. It is a pivotal story. Many (most?) of the other stories refer to Rusterman's, and either refer to it as being owned by Marko (before this story), or having been owned by Marko (after this story). It's like the book where Archie first meets Lily Rowan -- it's one of the pivotal books to the series.

As for the story, many others have summarized it here. I would point out that it really shows the depth of loyalty that Mr Wolfe has for his friends.

Many of the regulars (Fritz, Inspector Cramer, Stebbins, Saul) only make brief appearances, as the bulk of the story takes place outside of the United States.",Amazon Customer," May 22, 2022",5.0,dp
Easily the worst so far,"It's a well-written book, of course; if these characters weren't Wolfe and Archie (and Marko) it would be perfectly fine. First of all, despite the extreme provocation Wolfe has, from the initial murder report, it feels completely out of character for him. He pulls strings and takes a plane and he and Archie clamber around in the middle of the night, on foot, in the mountains of Montenegro. That's the worst part. Another part is that Wolfe is more insufferable than usual regarding the locality. He can find his way everywhere, in the dark, based on boyhood memories; he grandly tells the local men that he knows the place like the back of his hand, that he's been there, done that...it's all much more braggy than usual, perhaps simply because he's out of his usual context. The last part of my dissatisfaction is that I myself simply have no interest in this kind of cloak-and-dagger, Commie-manipulating, foreign travel stuff. I may reread the Wolfe corpus someday (I probably will, but so far am still on my first read-through, so it will be a while), but I'll give this one a miss.",Kat H," May 22, 2022",5.0,dp
,"One of the most beloved elements of a Nero Wolfe book is the world Stout created. The brownstone the characters, sending Archie to bring people, Fritz, Saul, Cramer, Stubbins, the genius of the solution, etc. None of that is in this book. He ""solves"" the case be overhearing some people torturing the murderer. He navigates what is depicted as a very dangerous part of the world with puerile transparent strategems. He has Wolfe encountering and surmounting extreme physical challenges. Even Archie's wisecracks have a forced false note.

Nothing like a real Nero Wolfe book,"This is my least favorite Nero Wolfe book. Parts of it are boing, it's uninteresting that they are in Montenegro, and the plot isn't very good. Also, there's almost no comic relief and the whole thing is contrary to what you'd be used to in a Wolfe book--Wolfe not leaving his house, Archie (and sometimes others) doing the actual legwork, Wolfe's funny and often arbitrary temperament, Archie's jokes and interactions with women, etc. It's just far belo what I expect from Stout, and it's not worth buying, in my opinion. The mystery and plot are kind of thin, and there aren't really any very interesting characters. I wouldn't recommend it. I usually re-read my Nero Wolfe books dozens of times. In the years I've owned this one, I read it twice. The only reason I even read it a second time was to make sure that I was fair/accurate in how I felt about the book. I was. It wasn't worth the second read.",john samuelson," May 22, 2022",5.0,dp

Not a fan,A wondrous story giving fans of Nero a great deal of insight into a world of pre-NYC Wolfe. A rare cold war look into partisan participation in a part of the world that has been much in the news in recent times but not so much when actually written. A story that could not happen in the post 9/11 ERA but very possible in the 50's & 60's. The elements of any Rex Stout mystery involving Nero & Archie are all there perfectly in place to stump the reader.

One of Rex Stout’s best mysteries,"I guess Stout wrote this to wrap up some historical questions that are referenced in the prior books. Unfortunately the story and the circumstances don't do the job. Almost all of this could have been covered in a flash back mixed in with another, better told story.

There is little of the wry relationship between Archie and Wolfe and the constant interpretation of different languages makes the telling cumbersome. Early in the story Atchie essentially asks the question - Why am I here?. It is apt; the story could have been told without him. Even the ending is unsatisfying - with so much detail in the prior pages, the ending just sort of happens.

More unbelievable is the physical exertion Wolfe is supposed to have undertaken. In all the other books he can barely get his own beer. Now to have him trek through some very rough, mountainous terrain with just a few foot sores is patently unbelievable. This is a good book only if it is the last one you read of the Wolfe series and you are desperate for more - as I was. Disappointing at best.",Dea Van Patten," May 22, 2022",5.0,dp

Even though Stout dashed off a few that were marginal, there was always an impossible mystery to be solved and the conflict between the rascal Archie and the egotistical Wolfe to keep it lively, while Stout worked the old formula. There was none of that here. This was a revenge plot that he tried to make happen with his familiar, decidedly non-vengeful, characters. And he sends them to Italy and Montenegro, but gives no evidence of even having bothered to look those countries up in an encyclopedia to give us some description of the foreign locales.

,"This book was published in 1954. The time in which the plot is set is also 1958. The time in which the plot is set is also 1954. Current events in this period: Senator Joseph McCarthy is censured, bringing an end to his witch hunt of Communists; The Supreme Court rules on Brown v. Board of Education, stating that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional;
President Eisenhower signs into law the new social security bill funded by employers and employees; first sub-4-minute mile run on May 6th by Roger Bannister; Swanson introduces TV Dinners. This is the 24th Nero Wolfe mystery. This book has an audio file and is whisper-synced. I listened as much as read this book. The narrator is Michael Prichard who is very skilled. If anything, the book sounds better than it reads!
This is one of the few stories in which Wolfe leaves his brownstone. Not only does he leave his house, but he also travels back to his homeland – Montenegro. Montenegro is a petite country in the south-east of Europe, next to Croatia and opposite of Italy. This is also one of the few stories where we glimpse Wolfe’s life before New York, and his career as a private detective.
This book “wears well”. By that I mean that I read (listen to) this book about once a year and always find it interesting and the characters intriguing, especially in audio.

"Great Beginning and Ending, but Middle is Weak","This novel opens with a shocking and truly sad murder. The victim is one of Nero Wolfe’s genuine friends, Marko Vukcic. Marko either appeared or was mentioned in just about every Nero Wolfe novel to this point. He was a world class chef who was one of the few people that Wolfe would leave his house for. He could also motivate Wolfe to take on tasks Wolfe didn’t want to. They were genuinely friends and Stout open the novel by having Marko killed in what is essentially a drive by shooting. Wolfe is so upset that he both goes to the morgue to see the body and actually visits the crime scene. He then vows to bring the killer to justice starting what should have been the best and most powerful of Nero Wolfe stories.

Should have been, but didn’t quite make it. Wolfe does things that one would never have believed based on the rest of the series. He and Archie sneak into Montenegro in search of the murderer (and the murderer of yet another victim close to Wolfe) and frankly it just didn’t feel like a Wolfe mystery. The whole middle of the book, Archie and Wolfe stumble from one event to another and don’t seem to have to do any detecting to learn the identity of the murderer. It wasn’t particularly enjoyable. But then, Stout remembers what makes Wolfe great. Rather than have Wolfe kill his friend’s murderer, Wolfe decides to find a way to get back to New York City where he can face justice. Seeing as the killer is an agent of a communist government and is in that communist country, this seems a very tall order to fill. But it’s Nero Wolfe we’re talking about. And just as he solves his case, he saves the story.",J. Folk," November 29, 2021",4.0,dp
,"Wolfe’s oldest and closest friend, Marko Vulcic, is shot down on the street. Wolfe vows to bring his murderer to justice. This is no easy matter and involves going to Montenegro via England and Italy, since the murder is likely to be political. Marko was deeply involved in supporting freedom fighters in ontenegro .

Wolfe and Archie end up dressed like peasants, eating non-gourmet meals, climbing mountains, walking miles, and evading many dangers. Archie is out of sorts because Wolfe does all the talking and navigating (Wolfe speaks the lingo, Archie doesn’t).

This is an adventure story, as well as a novel of detection. It’s fun, thanks to Archie’s caustic humor. And Wolfe’s tribulations away from his customary luxuries are amusing. We get a different view of Wolfe in this book. But Archie is still Archie and a good man in a fight.

I like domestic crime better than foreign intrigue, but any Nero Wolfe mystery is hard to put down.",Book lover -Philadelphia," November 12, 2021",4.0,dp
Wolfe & Archie suffer hardships in pursuit of a killer,"I had never read a Nero Wolf mystery, just watched or listened to them. Although hard to picture Wolf roughing it, the mystery was fun. I had missed the fact he was from Montenegro, so that part of his background was intriguing.
The mystery of a violent partisan war mixed with the murder of a restauranteur in New York was very clever, it worked well.
The integrity, sense of justice, of legality, of propriety that are part of Wolf's character, receive a development and revealing that are illuminating for the additional works I have seen.
Somehow, it was still stand out as an oddity compared to the other pictures I have from reading of Nero Wolf as a very rotund, nearly immobile detective very dependent on Archie.",Adam Graham," May 6, 2022",4.0,dp
,"I went to my bookshelf collection of Nero Wolfe books and pulled this one to reread, after many years. Why? I'd read Tea Obrecht's THE TIGER'S WIFE (just named as one of 2011's best) about Yugoslavia and had read Geraldine Brooks' PEOPLE OF THE BOOK, about the Sarajevo Haggadah and politics in that corner of the world, and thought it would be interesting to see what Stout had written back in l954. Absolutely fascinating! Reading all three very different books gives a fuller appreciation and understanding, not that it would hurt to read a non-fiction book for ALL the facts.

As far as this book goes, it is an anomaly in the Wolfe canon. Unlike all the other books, Wolfe not only gets out of the house but out of the country. To see him engaged in such exotic pursuits as hiking a mountain in the dark and negotiating with the Yugoslavian secret police in their language is a treat. Stout handles the change in language very easily, with Wolfe telling Archie what was said after the fact. This helps the book flow smoothly but one is never in doubt that the setting is different and exotic. As usual, Stout has various red herrings along the way, nods to Wolfe's brilliance and Archie's iconoclastic personality - and the actual mystery is fascinating. Lots of humor and sarcasm from Archie which is always fun.

I wouldn't recommend this as a first book by Wolfe since it really does help to know the cast of characters from other books. However, it is a very good stand-alone read if you happen to pick it up. And maybe it will whet your appetite to read other Wolfe books.",J. Woster," November 13, 2021",4.0,dp
Nero Wolf in an Odd Setting,"Having firmly established the rules of Nero Wolfe's first few books, Rex Stout felt free to force Wolfe to bend or break some of his rules. Other than In the Best Families, Stout never forced Wolfe to break so many rules as he did in The Black Mountain.

Wolfe's lifelong friend Marco Vukcic is killed and Wolfe leaves the Brownstone in a cab to pay a visit the crime scene and goes to question witnesses. Then, tracing Marco's murder to his support of Montenegrin rebels opposing the Yugoslav Government under Tito, he and Archie fly to Italy and cross the Adriatic an old boat and begin a hike to the place o f Wolfe's birth under assumed names with no passports. Archie doesn't speak any of the languages, so he has to rely on Wolfe's translations to even let us know what is being said.

This is definitely not the typical Nero Wolfe story, which is what some people don't like about it. However, I thought this story worked very well. It was thought provoking in many ways, not the least of which was how much of Wolfe's eccentricity was put on as he abandons many of them in order to complete this mission to track down Vukcic's killer. We also have a few hints of what Wolfe's life was like before he departed for America. Stout as he does in countless novels, breathes life into his setting.

Stout's Yugoslavia is a Cold War backwater where you don't know quite who to trust and the oppression of the Communists has cowed the Montenegrin people, a fact that clearly pains Wolfe. The story is filled with intrigue and espionage on multiple levels.

The story does lack the same level of influence for Archie. There's no girl for Archie to chase as he can't understand one word of the languages, thwarting any romantic inquiries. Archie also gets little chance to mouth off to authority except in the first few chapters which are set in New York.

However, this is one novel where the spotlight is rightly on Nero Wolfe, who shines. The story encounters Wolfe dealing with his most personal loss. Wolfe, ever the master of words, uses action instead to show his feelings about Marco as he travels half way around the world to bring Marco's killer to justice. Of course, words come in handy when, in the face of the lawlessness dominating his homeland, he decides to get killer back to the United States trial without extradition. To achieve this, he has to create one of his most elaborate and risky rouses he's ever undertaken. And even then, the action doesn't let up until the final page.",Ohioan," November 16, 2022",4.0,dp

A different Nero Wolfe and very relevant today,"Okay, I confess I'm having great difficulty rating this book. It probably deserves three stars because of the improbabilities and flaws in the plot. On the other hand, it has some of the greatest scenes in all of Wolfe-dom, because they are so unusual and because readers get to see Wolfe in a new light. After Wolfe's best friend, Marko Vukcic, is murdered, and Wolfe's adopted daughter, Carla Lovchen, is also murdered, Nero takes a plane to Yugoslavia, Archie in tow. Here, in Montenegro, the country of Wolfe's birth and youth, the fat detective speaks the language, and Archie doesn't. Wolfe knows the terrain and Archie doesn't. Wolfe knows the foods, Archie doesn't. On and on it goes, and some of the scenes are quite funny, as when Nero and Archie spend the night burrowed into a haystack. If you enjoy the Nero Wolfe novels, I recommend you read this book, but only after you have read at least ten of the ones published before this one, so that you know Wolfe in his brownstone element and can better appreciate him out of it. Otherwise, what will stand out is the weak and improbably plot.",Loves Books & Movies," November 13, 2021",4.0,dp
,did not read--will order again. all Nero Wolfe books are good.,ealovitt," July 28, 2022",4.0,dp
My least favorite Nero Wolfe,"Someone in a car on the street outside his apartment has shot and killed Marko Vukčić. Wolfe’s adopted daughter Carla comes to remonstrate with him for not being as involved in “the noble cause” of freedom in Yugoslavia as Marko was. It probably got Marko assassinated. Wolfe feels about Marko as he always did, that he was gullible and oversanguine and naïve, but it is now a point of honor to find his killer. Then Carla disappears. Wolfe gets in touch with Telesio in Bari, Italy, who finds out Carla is there. So is Marko’s killer. Then he learns Carla has been killed. Wolfe makes his decision. They’re going to Montenegro.
Today the premise of a morbidly obese, middle-aged detective from Manhattan scampering up and down mountains in the dark and eavesdropping on torture sessions inside remote Roman forts on the Albanian border is pretty silly. So is Wolfe in a knife fight (but Archie shoots the other guy). More serious for a mystery is the clumsy device of explaining everything by having the torturer give a long speech with all the details which the victim presumably already knew—the speech is for us. And since they already knew what he had done, what was the torture about? To be fair, this probably went over well enough in 1954. The Houston Chronicle wrote that “Nero Wolfe fans will be overwhelmed… A contender for first place.” By the Seventies and Eighties everyone was reading John le Carré and Len Deighton and of course standards were much higher. Even so, Stout was a little out of his depth here. And as a murder mystery it wasn’t well crafted. Stout did not have tight control of the storyline (evidently he did not know exactly where it was going); the ending was abrupt. But the book has tone and color and novelty we see only in a few other books that got Wolfe and Archie outdoors; it’s packed with details of the physical environment; it’s funny; and it’s justice (not revenge) for the death of a good man. One remembers Marko’s romantic vulnerability in Too Many Cooks and his compassion for Archie, “my poor young friend,” after Wolfe abandoned him in In the Best Families. We miss him. Newcomers to the corpus should postpone this one and first read The Rubber Band, Too Many Cooks, Some Buried Caesar, Murder by the Book, Champagne for One, Too Many Clients, The Father Hunt, Death of a Doxy, and of course The Doorbell Rang.",T.

However, I would have to agree with reviewers who don't recommend this book to someone new to the series.

This is a rare opportunity to observe Nero Wolfe out of his element. Nero's closest friend (Marko) and owner of Rusterman's, his favorite restaurant is murdered. Wolfe & Archie fly to Yugoslavia in search of the killer. YES...Nero leaves his Brownstone to solve a murder. Unheard of but it at long last it has happened.

This is a first for Nero with Archie by his side of course. I listened to this (and I've read the book) on CD masterfully narrated/performed by Michael Prichard. If you haven't listened to Nero Wolfe on CD by this artist please stop depriving yourself of a real treat.

,"I enjoy Archie and Nero in their typical relationship dynamics and solving mysteries, but this was more of an action-adventure with Archie unable to contribute much. They traveled all over and then have the solution to whodunit handed to them. Nero showed how clever he is by how he managed to get them in and out again alive, but it's his mystery-solving skills that I enjoy reading about.

I also had a hard time believing Nero Wolfe would really go tramping all around on rugged terrain. We're repeatedly told in this series that he only rarely will even leave his house. It would have made more sense (though admittedly been less exciting) for him to hire someone to find out the information and then cleverly convince the murderer to come to him. I think this is mainly one for Nero Wolfe fans who want to know more about Wolfe's pre-American life. It was a fun read but not as interesting to me as his mystery-focused stories.",Michael Murray," December 20, 2021",4.0,dp
all at great expense while he has no client,"....sure broke the rule this time. We all know about Nero Wolfe...eccentric, overweight, beer drinking, orchid growing, house-bound genius....he hires others to get his data, then figures it all out from the comfort of his custom made chair. Rex Stout based his ""American Sherlock"" on Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's older, more brilliant, brother who only appears in two of the stories...[and, actually, Wolfe left the house a number of times over his 40 year career].

It may be silly to avoid giving away the plot here; anyone reading this probably has the story memorized, and is just looking for a replacement copy. But, I can say that this is the most ""personal"" of the Nero Wolfe books; Wolfe had few friends...when the oldest, and closest, is killed, there is no limit to what Wolfe will do to assure proper justice under law. In many ways, it is the most complicated of the stories, but a grand master like Rex Stout had no problems keeping everything clear....

One regret...when staying over in Rome, Wolfe is asked to meet with the ambassador; after commenting that the ambassador is ""a woman"", he declines. She isn't named, but Clare Boothe Luce was quite famous when this was written...Stout probably had valid reasons for not using Mrs. Luce as a ""fictional character""; I think it would have done Wolfe a lot of good, and provided us some fun, for him to meet a woman who was more than a match for his intellect...just a thought.",carlaf," December 20, 2021",4.0,dp

,"I have read this book...granted, it's been a while. While most of the information is accurate, please be warned and be careful about placing any faith in the words of this author. Miss Montenegro gives mixed information about the world of the occult....its confusing, at best. She rightly points out that parents need to be engaged in the choices made for their children's entertainment. And she's right about the fact that our children, and ALL of us, have an enemy, who is attempting to seduce ALL to his side. However, she's offered conflicting reports of what is safe for children and what is not. She has since given GLOWING reports of movies like The Hunger Games, making the comment that ""There are no occult or New Age themes in this film."" Which is totally untrue. Miss Montenegro makes this claim simply because the heroes are ""not supernatural."" She has also recently admitted to currently owning a Ouija Board, which, she says, is just a ""thing"". So be sure to be prayerful and discerning when accepting the advice given in this book. Keep in mind that the author is still being strongly influenced by Buddhism and astrology!

We have now become desensitized ""to the bizarre, to violence, and to evil. This desensitization gradually increases, but often in ways so subtle, the person is unaware of it. It is as if invisible calluses develop on the person's spirit, mind, and emotions. This effect may only be noticeable to others after a period of time."" This chapter ""Calluses on the Soul"" alone is worth the price of the book.",P. Laws," February 17, 2020",1.0,dp
"""Spellbound"" is Amazing!","As a child and family counselor, I found this book to be very helpful in discerning the influences that children and teens are exposed to on a regular basis.

This is a fantastic easy read and I would highly recommend it.",Whispering Willow," April 23, 2019",1.0,dp

This is an excellent book for helping parents understand the incredible power of the supernatural.

,"When I learned about this book, I was interested due to having met and spent considerable interaction time with this author years ago. My faint hope was that her continuance of minor magical practices while Christian would eventually lead to a more balanced, deeper, and less hypocritical approach. This book might be desirable if you are seeking the sensationalist in-church Christian occult-entertainment circuit experience in print. Note the title of ""Spellbound"" and dark cover in that regard! However, you can get far more complete information from some Christian ministry websites for free. And, if you are willing to venture further, non-Christian websites have extensive general and specific articles that cover literally any specific belief system. Also, read her CANA website articles first since authors do recycle their prior work into books. Her family and friends are naturally supportive (see other reviews) but this book simply lacks the depth that a Christian would need to talk to a serious occult practicioner of any age intelligently.",Deborah," March 9, 2020",1.0,dp
Great book on Santa Muerta,"I bought this book because my teen son bought a board game I was concerned about.

I bought this one, excited for the blending of letters and cooking. It is such a sweet idea, and written by a grandma and grand daughter. But it really lacks polish. There is at least one recipe that leaves out a key ingredient in the recipe list, some of the recipes are too simple/pointless, and the pictures are like someone photographed things in their kitchen with a flip phone and a flash. They get the point across but the lighting and staging is, well bad. One recipe uses words for the measurements for no apparent reason, some recipes don’t have measurements of any kind...

rare study of feuding tribes in the Balkans,"Back in graduate school I once wrote a paper on Albanian tribal blood feuds for a course on kinship and family. Though there was a book about the Laws of Lek, which traditionally governed those feuds, there were no anthropology books about the realities of the process in the Balkan mountains. I had to scrape up information from all kinds of sources. Many years later I read ""Broken April"", a wonderful novel about Albanian blood feuds by Ismail Kadare, but until now, I had never read anything else. BLOOD REVENGE is an excellent study of the feuds and connected customs, beliefs, and expectations among the mountain tribes of Montenegro (formerly independent, then part of Yugoslavia, now independent again). These hardy souls, along with some Catholic tribes of Albania and Kosovo, managed to remain almost continually independent of the Ottoman rule that shrouded the Balkans for centuries.
The author did his work in the mid-1960s and the book came out in 1984, so anthropology becomes social history here. However, when I ventured into the Albanian mountains (not far from Montenegro) in 1996, I met people who were involved in blood feuds, which had returned after the end of ""communism"".
Why did Montenegrins engage in these destructive activities when surrounded by a powerful enemy? My question is the basic one which Boehm tries, quite successfully, to answer. He argues that in societies without any strong central authority, crimes, injustices, and even insults can lead to murder, but there is no one to enforce a law, nor is there any prison. The resulting system is one of managed or socially-controlled tit for tat killings, involving clan or tribal members. There was a well-known process for such murder and for reconciliation as well. Before the emergence of the Montenegrin state in mid-19th century, the many tribes and their composite clans settled their grievances by feuding. Honor demanded it. A person who did not retaliate was usually ostracized as weak and unfit to be in society. If you had shed another clan's blood you had to either fight or emigrate. Boehm takes examples from several other societies---Inuit, Bedouin, Jivaro, Nuer (South Sudan), and Enga (Papua New Guinea)---to show that various styles of feud existed around the world. Because by the 1960s, feuds had come to an end in Montenegro, Boehm used historical records as well as interviews of villagers (who still identified with their tribes) in which he tried to discover the moral legitimacy of feuding. I respected him for not condemning the feuding tribesmen, but instead trying to find out what they felt about it. He concludes that it probably lessened conflict rather than increased it. In war, the sky was the limit; you killed any enemy you found, but in feuds, killing was tightly controlled.
His stories of life in Montenegro, some excellent black and white pictures, translations of old records of 18th and 19th century feuds, and a very clear exposition without jargon are the positive sides of this interesting book. However, I think he hammered his points home until they became somewhat repetitive, so the last part of the book was not as interesting as the first.",James-philip Harries," June 30, 2023",3.0,dp
,"Boehm very astutely tackles a society in the often misinterpreted and misunderstood Balkan peninsula. He combines ethnographic and historical inquiry in a very methodical and comprehensive approach to the concept of blood feuds as they existed in tribal Montenegro before it attained nation status. He not only details the doings of the blood feud, but also gives a necessary background of cultural values and social structure that supported this cultural phenomenon. Most importantly, he convincingly brings to light the ideological compulsion and perspective of the Montenegrins themselves, in justifying how the blood feud could be a culturally accepted institution without stigma, a concept alien to most Western sensiblities. His writing style is never dry, and he minimalizes the use of jargon...it is a wonderful intro to the processes of ethnography and ethnohistory, while also delving into a sadly neglected region of the world.

Montenegro was a ""Christian"" redoubt against the occupying Turk and never fully succumbed to the invader. It was also riven by feuds, from clan to clan and sometimes from tribe to tribe.
Knowing that you will be expected to avenge a murder, or be murdered in your turn, is not a recipe for a tranquil life. Boehm shows however that this uncertainty, and the surprisingly precise rules that surrounded this revenge culture, actually helped it survive against its external enemies.

My minor critiques are that sometimes the road numbers aren't conspicuous and that the size of the map makes it unwieldy (lots of folding and re-folding, which more quickly deteriorates the paper). Please know that the countries' road signs most often use ""city destinations with arrows pointing the direction"" (e.g. ""Split --->""; imagine lots of traffic circles, which actually work very well) rather than ""road number with direction"" (e.g. ""A1 south"").

Interviewed by his son, David, Enrique Montenegro discusses his work, his influences, and his life over the course of four days in 1992.

He is a Palero who wants to be a Quimbandero, but the two systems are different and initiation in one does not automatic confer knowledge (or the necessary expertise) of the other!

This book, just like Montenegro, has very little to do with Quimbanda or Kimbanda - its another sad attempt by a Palero to make himself into a Quimbandeiro! The book is misguided, full of inventions and made-up nonsense! The rituals he shares are cheap copies of Palo and Espiritismo - 90% of the ingredients he uses are not even known in Brazil, like Florida Water! His interpretation of what he calls ""mysteries"" is incorrect and may come from internet research rather then actual involvement in the tradition. His information on the kingdoms of Kimbanda is completely inaccurate and made up, adding useless information to buff up the number of pages in the book. His ""initiatory degree system"" is an attempt to make money by selling more initiations then necessary - and making up initiations into Aje (Iyami Oshoronga), into Egungun, Ozain and other, which are not even part of Kimbanda!

dark tale,"This map was a little bit difficult to read - the publishers chose to use very small typesetting, and all the text looks rather homogenous. This coupled with the extreme detail of roads and place names in multiple languages makes it a very busy map indeed. As far as a map goes, I guess it has everything one needs to get from point A to point B. But we found it rather tedious to use and settled on a National Geographic map as our primary source while driving the beautiful back roads of Montenegro and beyond.

Also, the map is WAY too expensive for what it is. I paid just under $15.00 on Amazon. It should have been no more than five dollars.",Tyler The Guy Dude," March 10, 2022",4.0,dp

,"This is the best out of the series! Thoroughly enjoyed it. Looking for Book Four, but not finding it anywhere. Also did not find how many books are in this series…thinking it’s wrapping up soon though?",Jeremiah," May 22, 2021",4.0,dp
Good Vegan book,"After reading the first two books in the series, I was delighted to see the third installment; needless to say, I grabbed it right away. In book three, Victor continues his search for a “cure” from his curse and is soon offered a possible solution by a doctor who is aware of his dark secret. However, it is impossible to tell if Victor will even survive the procedure and whether he’ll remain the same man afterward. In the meantime, Valentina is still tormented by a dark presence haunting both the Montenegro cemetery and even the mansion itself, and Victor will have to act fast before something irreparable happens to his beloved. Add old acquaintances, werewolves, mermaids, and demons to the mix, and you’ll get yourself a perfect Gothic read that you won’t be able to put down. Beautifully written, dark and haunting, it’s a great choice for all fans of the genre. Highly recommended.",Liane devera," December 1, 2022",4.0,dp
,"Estela Vazquez Perez is an excellent writer who is fully immersed in, and fully understands, her genre. Therefore, if you are a fan of gothic romance you are in for a treat. The story is dark in places, as it should be, and the images will stay with you, which is the hallmark of quality writing.

This book is part of a series, but can be read as a stand-alone. However, I fully recommend all the books in this series and other novels written by this author. Very imaginative. Very impressive.",Jennifer Salerno," August 26, 2021",4.0,dp

Libro 💯,"Enfin un ouvrage non partisan qui fait le point véritablement sur l'annexion du Monténégro par les serbes à l'issue de la première guerre mondiale avec la complicité de certains des vainqueurs alors que cet état faisait virtuellement partie de ces derniers malgré son effondrement et sa capitulation de décembre 1915 !
Avec talent , l'auteur présente l'arrière-plan historique , relate sa participation au conflit et les raisons de sa défaite militaire ,le départ en exil de son roi ainsi que tous les événements qui ont suivi en détail (rôle des différentes grandes puissances ,action du gouvernement serbe , assemblée de Podgorica ,mouvement de résistance armé de janvier 1919 à la fin 1924 ).
Un épisode éclairant et très utile à rappeler lorsqu'on se souvient de toutes les réticences soulevées par certains , il y a peu de temps encore , lorsque le Monténégro a exprimé son droit à l'auto-détermination!

,"UNA HISTORIA MUY BONITA AL ESTILO FREYA, YA QUE NOS TIENE ACOSTUMBRADAS A ESOS ARGUMENTOS QUE NOS ENVUELVEN Y ENAMORAN.
UN AMOR QUE A PESAR DE LAS BARRERAS LOS PROTAGONISTAS ENFRENTAN CON TODAS SUS FUERZAS, SE PODRÍA DECIR QUE ES UNA AMOR QUE NACE DESDE LO VISCERAL.

History lesson and great story in one.,"This is the story of the author and three generations of the Koljenovic family. Intermixed with the author's personal story is history of Montenegro, the Bulkans and Yugoslavia. The authro expresses his feelings of communist rule, and his quest to escape it. He speaks of the blood feud that was going on on Montenegro in the mid 20th century.

This was an okay book. The story was kind of all over the place, and at times, I found it a bit bland. There was some really good parts that kept me reading, but overall, it wasn't a great book. And it only takes place 50% of the book in Montenegro. I was hoping for more. I did learn a bit about the country and the wars that went on in the 20th century, so I will hold onto this one for now.",victor coenen," May 20, 2021",5.0,dp
,I know the book is classified as fiction but it is based on historical events and is a great book if you are interested in the balkan region history. The author weaves a great story around these historical events that keeps the book interesting throughout.,Kevin Canales," May 26, 2021",5.0,dp

,"Koljenovic describes how it really ""must have been"" under communist rule in Montenegro. In reading his personal story, with historical facts added, one can now fully understand why Montenegro wants to be seperated from the union of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro succesfull in withstanding the Ottoman empire under its heroic leaders of which King Nikola was the best known (58 year reign) deserves to become independant again. Especially after the long period of communism that has plundered and terrorized the brave inhabitants of the country for so long. Nathan Post has done a marvellous job in writing it all down in such a way that the reader wants to read it all at once.
