,"Firstly, this laptop hasi very robust i7-1370U CPU. Secondly, it has amazing non-touch OLED screen 2880 x 1800. Thirdly, it is very quiet, only once, after initial setup , when it came to updates, I've managed to hear a pitchy sound that did not last long.
Keyboard is comfortable, battery life maybe is not the best, but after initial full charge my swift laptop worked hard for more than 7 hours doing downloads and installations of quite a few software pieces (Chrome browser for instance), and battery still was above 35% of charge.
The real surprise was a total absence of bloat software from Acer, just a small utility that is responsible for computer's health, really small and not intrusive at all
In whole, I did not find anything to complain and a lots of satisfaction from this swift and qute laptop."," June 28, 2023",5.0
"This laptop is not only swift, but it is sweet choice","My computing needs are simple. I want a nice keyboard, high processing speeds, internet connectivity, a quality monitor display, and built in ports to connect my devices. If the computer is of a light weight, portable size, and long-lasting battery life, bonus! I work on the go and my computer travels with me. I was glad to take the Acer Swift Go 14 for a test drive, excited I was given the opportunity to experience this product and write a review for Amazon Vine.

I'll start by noting the bells and whistles. The Acer Swift Go 14 comes equipped with a touch screen. If you like being able to minimize windows, close browser tabs, and navigate with a tap of your finger, the good news is that the touch screen works! You can scroll with a swipe of your index finger, pulling your browser up and down. You can zoom in with a pinch, or zoom out by creating an expanse between your thumb and index finger. You can pick stuff from a menu. You can drag and drop items. The touch screen is responsive. It can be used.

This computer also comes equipped with fingerprint identification and security. If you encode your fingerprint and unlock your computer with a press of a button. Alternatively, you could stick with a PIN on the login screen. But if you like to make it zippy by holding your finger on the power button, you can zoom right into your homepage.

If you're a Windows user, the operating system will be familiar. The defaults are unsurprisingly to the Microsoft suite of products. Bing is the default internet browser. If you prefer other software applications, you can purchase and install them from the Microsoft store. I installed Zoom, Evernote, Tidal, and the Amazon Prime desktop client, and all work great. I added cloud storage applications. This machine comes with a number of software packages installed that I have no plans of using--Forge of Empires, McAfee, XBox Game Bar, WhatsApp, Spotify, and others--that I've opted out of. Be ready for a few offers and ads with setup that you can take of leave.

I've tried the on board camera and microphone with a couple of videoconferencing applications, and I'm pleased with the results. Smooth transmission, adequate pickup, and good video quality. This machine also comes with built-in Bluetooth capability, and has paired seamlessly with all but one of my devices, an older Logitech mouse. That was disappointing. On the plus side, I contacted Acer tech support to help me with the connectivity troubles, and I had a great experience with the technician on the other end of the chat. Acer's tech support team will be there for you while the machine is under warranty. Once the warranty expires, you pay for support (as with many other products).

Lastly, I'll comment on battery life. It's more than enough for me. Mileage will vary, depending on your usage. But when I've got it running, whether web-surfing, typing away, or streaming, I'm pleased with the battery life, and with the fact that the computer doesn't run too hot.

I'll finish where I began. My computing needs are simple. This computer meets those needs. I'm happy with my experience. I'm happy with how this things runs, with how it feels, and how it performs. I recommend it."," June 10, 2023",5.0
,"This is a really wonderful laptop, Im really impressed coming from M1 Apple laptops.
The screen is a high res 1920x1200 on a 14"" screen with pretty high DPI, which is quite nice considering some of the low res budget screens that are available. Also nice is that the screen tilts back very far and has a nice little feature that lifts the base of the laptop off the desk when opened to allow airflow.
The laptop is very fast, surprisingly so for basic tasks, with the I7 processor, but still lasts for hours. It comes with 16gb which is almost a requirement for windows now, but at least they didn't cheap out and stick 8gb in. this is especially important as the Ram isn not upgradable.
Also comes with 512 gb of storage which has a standard NVME port if you want to expand it.
The windows 11 interface is quite a bit different than the win10 im used to but is easy enough to get around. I did install windows 10 as I wanted to get that older feel, but ran into issues with drivers, as there are no win10 specific drivers, all win11 which work, but they are all scripts run from command and not easily installed. There is a recovery drive, so I was able restore back to factory with all win11 devices working as expected.
I like that it will charge with USBC and comes with a 65w charger, and it's a pretty modestly sized 65w charger at that.
It has a good set of inputs, 2 thunderbolt ports, *2* usb A ports, which is unusual these days, HDMI and a microSD card port, which is odd as SD to micro are so easy, but 99% of my cards ARE micro anyway.
The performance is pretty good, with Cinebench multicore coming up at 7100 which is very respectable for a light thin windows laptop. Geekbench 8100.
Even at full use, the fans are Very quiet, you can barely hear them, so the 'twin cooling' works pretty well.
Finger print reader works ok, Ive had a couple times where it wasn't accepting my finger but otherwise it's been good about 95% of the time.
Keyboard is pretty nice, no issues, but the backlight is a great add on. Touch pad is better than other windows laptops I used before. Very nice to use. Touch screen is nice, the screen doesn't leave smudges so even using it, the screen stay clean.
I did install Linux on it to test that out, and it went pretty well, except for the Bios having a built in raid controller which tripped up all the live CD installers until I found the control +S option in bios to turn off VMD. once I got past that, I was able to install Linux Mint, but I got tripped up by the intel Wifi card as that's not well supported, even in newer 5.x+ kernels. I ended up finding a fix and got it all working but it was not as simple as many other windows laptops, due to the win11 security.
Overall, its taken the top seat of windows laptops, and will be go to for any windows or now linux mobile work."," June 7, 2023",5.0
Happy!,"I am not a computer geek, but as a retired science-focused academic I’ve been using computers for my research for a long time, from mainframes to TRS-80s, using CPM, iOS, Windows, Linux and other operating systems on desktops, laptops, tablets, and several smartphones. I pay attention to hardware and its capabilities. I claim no expertise, but I have learned enough to know that advertising tends to brag about how wonderful a computer’s hardware is because such claims about technology sell. I get pulled in by that too, but most users should first ask themselves what they want to use a new computer for, what software they can use on it, and how fast it can get the job done. Instead, when I got this computer I got all hardware-related questions—How fast does this processor run? Can I change out the graphics or is it on board? Can I add more ram? The list goes on. The answers to such hardware questions are either in the Tech Specs or discussed well in reviews of the various components on other geek sites. Even early reviews of the Acer Swift Go 14 discuss how well the hardware components function together. As both single components or together, the hardware fares extremely well, but consider how you plan to use the Swift Go 14. If you are a high end gamer, you likely will find weaknesses, but if you use the Swift Go as most laptops are used, you’ll find the Swift Go 14 to be spectacular. Graphics are excellent for streaming video (and to answer a question I got, yes, the OLED screen does handle HDR as the specs tell you). They also run the Adobe Creative Suite products well and quickly, but I have never found a small laptop screen easy to use with Photoshop and just a touch pad, so I have a wireless mouse, but that is difficult for me even with the image zoomed in. But I probably won’t do much image manipulation on the small screen of the Swift Go’s 14 inch screen, but I will use Acrobat a lot. It runs Microsoft 365 products exceedingly well. The camera is spectacularly good for virtual presentations, meetings, or just chatting with friends on Team, Zoom, Skype, whatever. I can run my high end GIS and photogrammetry software without problems and fast, which is important for my fieldwork. The audio is adequate, but not terrific. Battery power is better than most laptops I’ve used except when high end graphics programs are running. You get an extremely capable laptop that hands-down, beats my Inspiron laptop, and at low price. The ergonomics are pretty good. It is very light and thin, which for travel and fieldwork is important. Yet, it has a solid feel to it. Acer says the Swift Go 14 has twin fans for cooling and runs cooler than most other laptops. Yeah, that’s hardware, and it’s true. I can sit with the laptop running on my lap for an hour and barely feel any heat. However, I feel significant heat from my old laptop within minutes. I truly value the biometric sign in via touchscreen or the keyboard power button. I have developed one dislike. Next to the hinges is a small protrusion that I assume is meant to protect the case, but it starts to dig into my leg after a time (see the pic attached). Would that keep me from buying this laptop? Not a chance! For the moment, the Acer Swift Go 14 does everything I want, and then some. This laptop is a wonder for both function and price!"," May 24, 2023",5.0
,"This is a solid little machine that is very light weight and easy to carry. The bag that comes with the laptop is really just a zippered pouch to protect the laptop from scratches. The bag does have two pockets so you can tuck the power supply and an external mouse in the smaller pocket when you're on the go.

My main use case for this laptop is to have a personal laptop that I can toss in my backpack when I run into the office. It's mostly getting used for email, web, word processing, playing some vintage games from GOG, and a little bit of light software development when I get an idea I want to test out over lunch. It excels in all these use cases.

One thing you'll want to take note of when buying one of these is that the RAM is soldered onto the motherboard. So you cannot upgrade RAM after purchase. The SSD however appears to be an m.2 that can be upgraded. In order to do so you'll need to remove all the screws on the base and carefully peel the bottom panel off. Then find the m.2 wrapped in a protective sleeve in the one corner. Acer appears to have a website that lists compatible m.2 modules.

The power supply is a small 65 watt affair and this laptop uses USB-C for power so you should have an easy time finding alternative power supplies in the future.

It has a nice array of ports for connectivity. HDMI for an external monitor, two thunderbolt, two USB-A ports, an audio jack, and an SD card reader built in. Coming from a work laptop that is heavy on dongles I really appreciate not having to carry more dongles to use this.

One feature that really is icing on the cake is the fingerprint reader built into the power button. It was very easy to setup during the initial Windows setup process and I haven't had to enter my password or pin since.

Windows did need to go through a number of updates upon first boot, and there's a small amount of bloatware pre-installed. But, Windows does make it easy these days to remove bloatware.

All in all I really like this little laptop. It's light weight for easy carrying and snappy in terms of performance. It really would make a good machine for students or for anyone who needs to have a computer on the go."," May 4, 2023",5.0
"Nicely spec'ed machine, Win 11 is very fast, linux has wifi issues","I recently had the chance to work with the Acer Swift Go 14 laptop, and it has quickly become my go-to device for both work and play. As an Intel Evo verified notebook, it offers superior performance, faster Wi-Fi, and a long-lasting battery that charges quickly. It has truly provided me with an amazing laptop experience. Is it a desktop killer? No. But it is fantastic for computing on the go in an incredibly portable form factor.

Multitasking is totally possible with the Acer Swift Go, thanks to its powerful 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor and dedicated Intel Iris Xe graphics. Announced in earlly 2023, he Intel Core i7-1355U is a high-end mobile CPU that is based on the Alder Lake architecture. So this laptop puts you on the bleeding edge when it comes to processing chops. Whether I'm working on a teaching presentation, streaming my favorite videos, or playing games, this laptop consistently delivers outstanding performance.

One of my favorite features of the Swift Go is its 14"" 1920 x 1200 IPS display. The screen offers great color accuracy, deep blacks, and ultra-crisp image quality. Plus, the touchscreen capabilities allow me to easily tap and swipe my way through tasks, making it even more enjoyable to use.

The internal specifications of the Acer Swift Go are equally impressive. With 16GB of onboard LPDDR5 memory and a 512GB PCIe Gen 4 SSD, I have a reasonable amount of storage and enough memory for most applications.

Security is a priority for me, especially on a laptop away from home. The Swift Go's power button with a built-in fingerprint reader offers both computer protection and Windows Hello Certification. This helps to keep my laptop secure without compromising on convenience.

The Swift Go is sleek and lightweight, weighing in at just 0.59"" thin and 2.76 pounds. The high-end aluminum body easily fits into my bag. The eco-conscious OceanGlass touchpad is a thoughtful addition, aligning with my environmentally friendly values. If you haven't heard of OceanGlass, it's a touchpad that is surfaced with a sleek, glass-like texture and is made from ocean-bound plastic waste. It is eco-friendly because it helps reduce plastic pollution in the ocean by using recycled plastic waste.

The Acer Swift Go's 1440p QHD camera is perfect for video calls. The TNR (Temporal Noise Reduction) technology ensures high-quality imagery even in low-light conditions, while Acer PurifiedVoice with AI Noise Reduction keeps my audio crystal clear.

The Acer Swift Go 14 has exceeded my expectations in terms of performance, design, and features. It's an excellent choice for anyone seeking a powerful, portable, and visually stunning laptop that can handle a wide range of tasks with ease."," May 1, 2023",5.0
,"I use computers for various things. I have a desktop PC for all the gaming and really beefy computational stuff, don't do quite as much of this on a laptop. With 16 GB of RAM and a 512GB hard drive, this is ready for most needs. This kind of laptop is the perfect fit for occasional gaming and miscellaneous projects.

I ran some quick benchmarks on it, and everything seems to be performing at or above specs. The NVMe drive is responsive, Windows 11 boots quickly, and the touch screen is a nice bonus. It uses a USB-C style charger which will take up one of the two USB-C ports, and there are still two USB-A ports as well, so you can get around and do your thing without hauling a port expander or USB hub around. It does not have on-board Ethernet, which is a little bit of a bummer, but easily fixed with an external device.

I really like the fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello login. It's conveniently integrated into the power button. I don't care for the function key behavior. By default it's configured for the top row to act as media keys, and you have to hold down the Fn modifier key to get them to work as traditional F1-F12 keys. Most other brands do this and include some sort of key combination that swaps the behavior to be traditional by default and media keys with the modifier, which is especially handy if you occasionally use some apps that have a lot of function key shortcuts. The only way to toggle on this machine is from the BIOS/UEFI configuration screen, so there is no quick toggling back and forth.

I'm also not a huge fan of the half-sized up and down cursor keys. This is a space saving measure, but it makes gaming a little awkward. Also, they combined the Page Up/Down buttons with these so you have to use the function overlay key and tiny keys at the same time. A common keystroke in apps like Excel and Chrome is Control+PageUp/Down to switch tabs, so this requires a bit of contortion - I ended up using Control+Tab and Control+Shift+Tab instead. Likewise, the home and end keys are overlayed onto the left and right cursor keys, so if you're selecting large blocks of text from the keyboard, a shortcut like Control+Shift+End becomes the 4-fingered Control+Shift+Fn+Right. Of course, if you use an external keyboard with more buttons, you can bypass most of this. Overall, the keyboard does have a good feel, even if it is using some space-saving key removal. I'm not knocking the score for this, as it's pretty typical with other brands in this size as well, but you should be aware.

The case included in the bundle is a minimal zippered slip cover, and doesn't have any handle or strap. It's suitable for slipping into a book bag or hand-carrying short distances. There didn't seem to be much bloatware on the machine. There were a couple of one-time offers for McAfee, Office 365, and Xbox subscriptions, but nothing too egregious.

The fans seem to run at a reasonable speed and don't make much noise. The speakers are honest-to-goodness stereo, and there's a ""dts"" logo on the case, so I guess there's some spacial sound trickery going on to make it sound better. I haven't tried exploring this further or adjusting it, but it sounds good and most people would probably want to keep that on unless they're doing precision audio work in which case they would probably be using better headphones or speakers anyway.

The built-in camera looks pretty sharp, but it doesn't appear to support Windows Hello facial recognition. Still, it's just fine for Zoom calls and such.

All in all, this seems to be a lot of laptop for the money, focusing on the features that people use the most."," May 1, 2023",5.0
A highly capable laptop for almost every common use and then some. A low price too!,"I've been AMD fan for a very long time, but this Intel Evo just surprise me.
This laptop comes just as it should, 16G of RAM (8 is not enough), plenty of space in a very fast drive, the power button fingerprint reader is fast and reliable. Touch screen is responsive, screen in bright enough, and the 16:10 format gives more space and it's better for productivity.
Touchpad is on point and clicky. 1440p (2K) camera when most devices comes with 720p. Backlit keyboard for the night shift. Audio DTS, loud and clear. And plenty of connectivity options. I would have preferred a full SD instead of a microSD, since I usually shoot with a pro mirrorless. The HDMI 2.1 allows to output 8K or 4K 120Hz witch for a gamer or home theater enthusiast is a nice plus.
Its also nice the full chassis is Aluminum alloy, very sturdy and light t the same time.
Now what actually surprise me, the APU (that is how AMD call its CPU+GPU processors).
This comes with the latest top Intel Evo APU, the Core™ i7-1365U, announced just in Q1 of this year, so the best and newer of the ultra portable, including the best Intel integrated GPU, Intel® Iris® Xe with 96 units.
Well this setup is able to run Hogwarts Legacy on par with my 2021 Gaming laptop witch comes with a GTX 1650M with 4Gb of GDDR6, and looks better IMO.
If you are looking for a very portable laptop, that will allow you to play most games, including the latest and brightest, in low to medium quality, look no further, this integrated Intel GPU does the trick nicely.
So far I have no negatives or complains about this laptop. Support has been nice from Acer, drivers are updating well and without issues so far. It becomes my default laptop.
Almost forget, in best performance mode, the battery last about 6 hours, with display brightness at maximum, so with the recommended power configuration, probably will be able to get 10 to 12 hours. Playing a AAA game, I was able to get about 3 hours and still some power left, comparing with my gaming laptop that gets less than an hour gaming in battery and will not allow to set full performance, this one is the MVP.
SO VERY RECOMENDED... you will not regret it."," May 22, 2023",5.0
,"GENERAL USE
Seems speedy at this point, but you may want to uninstall some or all of the promo bloatware that comes bundled. A lot of it is unnecessary for my uses. Intel processor is great. I have a similar-range Dell laptop with an AMD, and it runs so hot that the fans go all the time. The Intel in this Acer is so much better; runs at normal heat levels that the fans aren't always working against.

SCREEN
Colors are fantastic and contrast crisply. The laptop also has a pretty great viewing angle.

TRACKPAD, KEYBOARD, & TOUCH SCREEN
Keyboard feels standard but comfortable. Nice to see the fingerprint reader is coupled with the power button since occasionally it isn't in other laptops. My one complaint is there is no alternative numpad accessible via a function key. Laptops seem to be phasing this concept out, but it basically means anyone on a laptop can't access ALT code functions without using the virtual keyboard or a power user key replacement tool. Sort of a niche complaint, but I have it.

I've had two (now three) Acer laptops over the years, and all have had excellent trackpads; genuinely, they seem much better than the competition's. This one's no exception. Smooth to touch, very responsive. Touch screen is also good and responsive. However, I dislike the hinge for turning the laptop into a tablet. It has central connecting pieces the two sides of the laptop work around, as opposed to a true and more seamless fold. When you open the laptop, this means it elevates slightly as the screen works around this hinge. As a result, it acts like a tiny stand and angles the keyboard. This isn't just an Acer thing; other laptops with touch screens are doing their hinges this way, too. Personally, I dislike it and find it annoying when using a lap desk, as it encourages the laptop to slide forward or not sit flush against a lap desk's guard, if you have one that has a guard.

SOUND
The sound in this laptop is surprisingly good. Its bass is about as good as you can expect from a laptop, in my opinion, and plugging in wired earbuds/headphones is also seamless. I've had a Dell laptop that had interference/noise from fans come through the earbud connection. This Acer doesn't have that issue at all. Everything sounds great."," May 9, 2023",5.0
Light weight for computing on the go,"This is a lovely little workhorse. I love that it came with a laptop sleeve (it's the little thoughtful things, you know).

But I didn't like that I couldn't use the computer, until I had a Microsoft ID or a Skype ID. On the one hand, I like that this sort of electronic paper-trail can make people think before they do nefarious things online, because they can be easily tracked, but I also don't like how much access Acer/Microsoft want into my life, in order for me to use their products. The setup process actually felt kind of invasive, all the tracking and them asking for access to different accounts, my fingerprint, etc. I guess if you don't care (b/c that info is mostly readily available anyway, through different means) it's fine. You also have to have an internet connection to set the computer up.

After the long setup process (its not open and go, like a Mac), the computer was ready to go. It's easy to navigate. Easy to use.

Oh, we couldn't get the fingerprint function to work.

I'll update this review if anything comes up, but overall, a nice little laptop."," June 23, 2023",5.0
,"I was provided this laptop to review and found this to be a very good laptop, fast wi-fi, good battery length, and overall good performance.

I decided to take this with my on a recent work journey to use as my personal device and watched some high quality movies on the flight. Also upgraded this to the pro version as I need remote desktop capabilities and had no issues with the upgrade. I have been running the Microsoft Office Suite as well as Adobe Creative Cloud apps such as Photoshop and Audition, all performing very nicely.

The power block is fairly large on this so you do need good space in your power strip, or use a small extension cord as I do so it fits in more spaces. There is no ethernet adapter, only wi-fi. As mentioned, the wi-fi is very good and fast however I like my devices wired so I popped on an ethernet adapter and connected straight away.

I also connected my Xbox wireless headphones and did some gaming. No, it doesn't run Flight Simulator too well but everything else seemed to work just fine.

I really like the integrated fingerprint scanner, it's built-in to the power button. For such a small receptor, I have found it to be very accurate and quick to sign in. I like using local accounts and had no problems with authentication.

I'm also very impressed with the 12 core design, gives it a good amount of power to go through tasks and the touchscreen is very responsive as well.

I like this laptop a lot, it's very light and functional. I think it is thinner than some tablets that I have seen and here you get a whole Windows desktop. Definitely recommend this device."," May 17, 2023",5.0
Great overall laptop - good performance,"Touch screen sensitivity is responsive. Battery lasts all day with moderate use. Lightweight and comfortable to use.

Great tablet computer,"Super lightweight and with a great battery life, this is an ideal laptop. The set up was quick and simple. The touch screen is brilliant with a very responsive touch and visually vibrant. Beautiful picture from the 1440p camera, so it works perfectly for face-to-face software. The twin air cooling system works great, although I still expect I'll get a pivot stand for it. Not having used a touch screen laptop before, I expected I might need to buy a mouse, but the track pad is actually very responsive and high quality. Simple and attractive design overall, and the keyboard is very comfortable to use. I wasn't expecting to have finger print scanning and facial recognition, but they're both there and work great. It's a really beautiful laptop with all the memory and processing capacity that I need. A great value for the price, I can't recommend this highly enough. Very happy!"," May 13, 2023",5.0
,"This laptop is great. I'm not a technology person, so this review is coming from someone who needs something easy and simple that works. This laptop is super easy and it comes with everything you need ready to go. I mostly use it for writing and internet searching. I love that the screen is a touch screen, I can actually use my fingers to zoom in on something just like I can on my phone. I find myself trying to do this on regular computers that aren't touch screen and I end up looking silly, lol. It's a lightweight computer but it doesn't feel cheap or flimsy.

,"I am not a computer expert and I don't use my laptop a lot so if you're looking for someone to explain all the whistles this may have, that's not me. I was excited to get this mostly because I have an old computer that is dedicated to my crafts and between Cricut Design Space and my antivirus program, that old computer is having trouble keeping up. This laptop was really easy to set up, walked me through most of the steps and it is very light weight. It is fast and responsive but the touch pad is a bit too sensitive in my opinion. It could also be because I am not really used to have a touch pad do I end up touching it by mistake. The case it came in is okay, I am probably not going to be using it much since the laptop will be mostly stationary in my craft room. So far this is good for my needs.

 Acer’s Swift Go 14” Intel Evo Thin & Light Laptop was very simple and quick to set up! It’s lightweight and stays pretty cool when running.

The Swift Go performs at a very nice speed and is pretty quiet. It charges quickly and the battery lasts a good 8 hours!

The speakers have great sound and clarity. I love that this laptop has a touchscreen. The wi-fi connectivity is simple and fast. The keyboard has a few uniquely sized buttons for space saving which won’t get much use as I plan to use a wireless keyboard and mouse with this laptop.

I am impressed Swift Go’s 1920 x 1200 IPS display that produces accurate, clear and crisp colors and images. The laptop carrying case is average quality, but appreciated as many competitors don’t include them with laptops.

I am going to use this laptop with great pleasure. I am very impressed with this product!"," May 3, 2023",5.0

 This is an unboxing of the Acer Swift Go 14. Overall, I was very impressed. Btw, the screen of the Acer in the video is at 50% brightness. I turned it up afterwards and wow, does it get bright! The speakers are very good. I'd say better than most laptops out there. Keystroke felt good and it is very light. The fans are pretty quiet, when they do come on.

,"I already owned a smaller Lenovo Chromebook that I snagged off of eBay for under $100, but it wasn't playing some videos anymore and was generally slow. But I do love Chromebook! Whenever I've purchased computers in the past (a few Apple, one HP), I always ended up using the Chrome browser anyway. Plus, I learned that Chrome is basically Linux, probably one of the most secure systems other than Apple, but we are not there sadly LOL

There is no downloading or joining anti-virus software because that protection is already built in to the OS. The setup takes a few minutes, but surely we can find something to do during that process.

I had a touchscreen on the old one, but honestly.....I found it annoying. If I wanted to scroll or expand the screen etc, it wasn't always responsive, but when I just brushed it accidentally with my fingers, it dumped me over to another page, typically to an ad. So I will not miss the touch screen! I've always used a mouse or the scroll buttons anyway in the past, so it took a minute for me to stop touching the screen. LOL

I don't know if this Chromebook has enough guts for gaming, but that's not my thing. It does everything I need it to. Did I mention I love the dark blue color?"," June 20, 2023",4.0
Beautifully sleek and responsive Chromebook!,"Some backgtound - I am not a big hardware head. I don't know much about the tech specs. I work on a 2022 13.3 inch MacBook Pro. I bought this to have an extra laptop for basic work tasks, and having something with decent battery life I can travel with.

I'm surprised at how high quality and user friendly this laptop is. It was bought for work - but quickly turned into our default handheld entertainment device (over our tablets).

I no longer use it sporadically. It's now an everyday device.

We use it for sharing photos with family and friends when they're over, for watching the NHL and NBA championships while outside in our yard, and on Saturday we streamed a soccer match in full HD via the HDMI port to a 70 inch screen with no issues (my MacBook was going to be used but I figured - let's test the Chromebook out.) That's what prompted me to write this review.

Lastly, I feel like I can throw it around and not worry about it breaking - I treat it like an old tablet, I've dropped it on the ground, no issues - I would never treat an expensive device like this, and yet, it holds up well.

Other than programming + photoshopping on my MacBook (a device that cost $1800) this $350 laptop can do nearly everything. And it's better than owning a tablet."," June 26, 2023",4.0
,"I consider myself an experienced (but not especially advanced) chromebook user. I've owned chromebooks from Toshiba, HP, Asus, Acer, and now this Lenovo Flex 5i. My family uses our chromebooks mostly for general web browsing and video streaming (youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.). We usually take at least one chromebook on vacations.

I've owned the 5i for a several days, and my initial impressions are all good. It feels solid, audio, backlit keyboard, screen, and touchpad are fine, and there is nothing that stands out as a flaw. Battery life seems ok so far. Web pages load fast enough, and speedtest.net shows it maxing out our 500Mb/sec internet connection. Weight is 3lb 1oz as measured on our kitchen scale. I like the dark-blue color.

Overall I'd say the Flex 5i is on a par with our Acer spin 713 (CP713-3W), altho I do slightly prefer the Acer's 3x2 screen. On the other hand, the Flex 5i is slightly smaller, which is a bit more convenient. Both have a quality feel, and the 5i was significantly less expensive. I paid $375 for the 5i.

As mentioned, this review is about initial impressions, and if my opinion changes, I'll update this review."," June 13, 2023",4.0
Surprised at how high quality (and it's now used more than our iPad),"I purchased this for home use - Lenovo 3i-15 - no gaming or heavy duty computing and it is ok for my needs. There is no backlit keyboI really wanted - I am disappointed about it because everything said it had one. Had to go thru 2 Amazon techs and 2 Lenovo techs to figure it out. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy - response time is good and battery is really good - lasts all day."," July 5, 2023",4.0
,"This is my third Chromebook and quite possibly my favorite. I came from an Asus C302, which, while great at the time was becoming long in the tooth with battery life and the touch screen responsiveness.

This is my first Lenovo and I have to say, it's fantastic. I knew what I was getting into with a Chromebook, but I really was surprised by the quality of this Chromebook, even after all the reviews.

The color - wow. It has to be seen in person and I LOVE the fact that the keyboard area mimics the outer shell. A very subtle and deep blue hue.

The keyboard looks and feels great. Very crisp and responsive, exceeding the feel and quality of laptops that cost four times as much. I don't really ever hear the fans except for a very quiet environment, and the heat seems about on par with what I've seen from previous laptops. That is to say - the fan kicks on sometimes and then it turns off. No big deal.

The weight is definitely something I had to adjust to, but in a good way. I feel like the weight is just about perfect although it could be a smidge lighter. It makes the unit feel of high quality rather than just cheap junk on the other hand.

The upward firing speakers are also a welcome change as my previous Chromebook had side firing speakers. The sound quality is quite decent, and surprised me even though the bass is a bit lacking. There is fidelity that is gained just by having upward firing speakers that can't be understated.

My only gripes would be that the display could stand to go a bit brighter for outdoor use, and near the track pad when I push the computer to move it slightly with my thumb into position, I can feel & hear a creak or a flex of some sort. Also at times the drag on the track pad is a bit much depending on the oil levels of your fingers.

Overall, a fantastic computer for the price - (I paid $299) and I would absolutely purchase again. I love the fact that the OS will be updated thru 2029. As with all Chromebooks, finding that harmony between hardware and ChromeOS updates is sometimes hard to find if you don't do your homework.

Cheers."," March 5, 2023",4.0

,"Me encanta este ordenador por su sistema operativo chromebook, al principio de cuesta acostumbrarte si has usado siempre otro sistema operativo, pero hay que decir que se prende muy rápido y la navegación es mucho más rápido que en un sistema windows.

No backlit keyboard,"I got this as a replacement for an earlier model, the Lenovo 330c (which I still use after 4 years). The 330c had two issues: 1) The case was plastic, and the lid developed several large cracks from hinge stress, and 2) It struggled to play videos, especially from facebook and news sites.

This newer model has a metal lid which should solve the cracking problem. It is also notably faster and has no problem so far playing any videos. One the downside, the battery life seems to be much less, and it is slow to wake up from sleep mode, including that it seems slower to reconnect to the wifi than the older model. UPDATE: Today, less than 30 days in, the unit would not start up. The white light on the power button just kept blinking after I closed the lid to move from the kitchen to the living room. I couldn't find any official Lenovo support online, but I did find a YouTube which sent me to try recovery mode (esc+circle-arrow fcn key+ power button) and I was able to power off. Powered up again OK. Worrisome. This unit does not sleep well.

The lighted keyboard is a nice new feature. I also like that the power cord can be attached from either side, since the nearest outlet always seemed to be on the 'wrong' side (and the left-side plug on the old model was always a bit in the way for left-handed folk like me). There's no HDMI port, but I only used that occasionally and it's addressable with a dongle.

Most things synch up pretty well making for an easy setup. I'm a bit old school and keep a lot on the machine memory rather than the cloud. This has plenty of storage for that, but of course that stuff doesn't synch and needs to be transferred. This won't open my Open Office files unless I upload them to the cloud, convert them, and download them back down. A bit of a hassle but not a deal killer.

A good purchase overall, and good enough to become my only computer. I'm going to shed my old desktop tower."," February 17, 2023",4.0

A touch of Class!,"I cannot believe I am saying this but the touchpad was the main reason I returned this Chromebook. It was simply frustrating to use. And I understand that this is a $300 Chromebook, but there is no excuse for a mediocre touchpad that lacks precision and usability if they managed to put in a great keyboard with good backlighting.

Everything else about this Chromebook is done exceptionally well. Granted, I am spoiled by Apple's touchpads (that cost exponentially more) but if only Lenovo puts in a precision touchpad and Chrome OS adds in some more flexibility to customize the touchpad behavior, I'd buy the next version in a heartbeat.

Additionally, I noticed that bluetooth devices (such as a mouse - which is essential given the touchpad's lack of usability) take a full second (or two) when they are moved after being idle for a while, which is rather annoying and mars the user experience. This is more on the Chrome OS and not on Lenovo.

So, while I have given it 4-stars, I suggest skipping this laptop if any of the above bothers you even the slightest and go with Asus Chromebooks that have much better touchpads."," March 21, 2023",4.0
,"I looked at my daughter's abyss blue Levono Chromebook, read good reviews about it & watched YouTube videos covering it, before I bought one for myself.
It has performed well & met my needs at an affordable price for over a month now. It is easy to use & has a lot of functionality/features. Screenshots & downloads are a breeze. The keyboard works good & the 13.3"" touch screen is sized right.
(Stylist pens that I was given at my local voting destinations during COVID work on the screen.)
The picture on the screen is okay, but it isn't as sharp or clear as I would like it to be. It can be difficult to see in a bright room or the sunny outdoors. Usually keeping the Night Light option turned On & the Dark Theme option turned Off works best for me.
Pop-up ads are very annoying & loud. I don't know how or if it possible to control online pop-up ads with this computer.
The sound is just okay too. I find myself constantly adjusting the volume. I haven't plugged in headphones/earbuds or tried to pair my bluetooth speaker (for better music/movie audio quality) to the chromebook yet.
The charger works as it should. The chromebook holds a decent charge. I do have to put it on the charger when I use it for several hours at a time.
The flexible outer housing is a combination of plastic & metal. - I love the abyss blue color. I do handle it with care because I want it to last several years.
I am pleased with my purchase so far & recommend the 8GB memory 128GB storage Lenovo Chromebook."," February 8, 2023",4.0
Decent if you can work with some annoyances...,"Before buying this laptop, I first purchased an HP flip screen laptop from Target. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I knew there had to be something better on the market!

I tried my luck on this laptop and immediately fell in love. While the prices were similar, the level of quality felt incomparable. Visuals on the screen are decent quality, and the touch screen is perfect. It's compatible with multiple styluses and works beautifully for drawing and sketching.

The keyboard is not back-lit, but the keys are decent enough for the price point. I use a Macbook Pro for work, and you should not expect this machine to act like that type of workhorse. Even just after sleeping for a day or two with programs running this little guy requires a restart. However, I feel perfectly satisfied with the product I received for this price point.

There are only two opportunities with this laptop:

* Battery Life - while at first this easily went a full week without requiring a charge, it's now beginning to need one every 4-5 days. I'm a little leery that it's losing power after about six weeks of solid use - but since I only use it at home, it's rarely an issue.

* Built-in mouse - this mouse is kind of crappy. I use a trackpad for my job every day and find this unit incredibly finicky. It leaps, it skips, it jumps - it is not steady and takes me longer to click to where I'm going as a result. I largely use my laptop on my couch, but if I were working or studying I'd definitely recommend an external mouse.

That said - for this price point, you're not going to get perfection. What you ARE going to get is a VERY decent computer that can surf the web, type emails, novels, what have you, and offer a very solid solution for drawing when you want to mix things up a bit."," March 3, 2023",4.0

Lenovo Chromebook Works For Me!,"Within our household, three children are gamers alongside two adult gamers. It's getting a little expensive now tbh lol. Over Thanksgiving break we all landed on Stardew Valley as a video game we enjoy playing together as a family, but our youngest sons' 12 yr old entry-level gaming laptop is dying, even with upgrading ram and a reset on that machine it can't handle most games anymore. So he wasn't able to play with us on his own rig. We took turns, but it just wasn't as fun.

Enter the Lenovo Flex 5i. I took the time to enable the Linux Beta, went through the process of getting steam set to 32-bit, and downloaded Stardew Valley. It runs smoothly, with no glitching/lag. I did make the Linux portion of the HD take more of a share than was suggested, 30 Gb vs 10 Gb to accommodate adding more demanding games. It runs Terraria and other similar titles beautifully. But this Chromebook doesn't stop there for us, we've been using it for web surfing, streaming movies, and as an extra device for homework when the school Chromebooks are slow/acting up. It's filling a niche that we truly didn't realize we needed in our home.

Overall: If you are looking to play some low-demand (side scrollers, dungeon crawling 32-bit games) steam games via Linux, then this is a great option. If you just need something to watch movies/youtube/surf the web it's more than powerful enough to handle that with ease. This Chromebook is sleek, peppy, and feels expensive even though we got it for under $300. My only minor complaint so far is the matte finish is prone to showing every fingerprint on the outside of the case, but at the same time, it lets us see how often it is being used and reminds us to clean it often.

But as a final note, for us, this Chromebook is a stop-gap/multi-purpose item to fill in when we need it. In late winter/early spring, our son will probably get a mini gaming PC since he isn't as big of a gamer as the rest of his siblings but may want to play more robust games. This Chromebook gives us some breathing room over the winter to research & shop for his future rig while allowing us all to play games together as a family."," December 9, 2022",4.0

,"This Chromebook is exceptionally value for money, as it has 8G of RAM and 128G of storage space. I set aside 20G for the Linux Debian OS, I now have 75G of storage to spare, I only installed a few Android apps, mainly for entertaining purpose. Being able to run Linux desktop software is very important to me, such as Libre office, Avidemux, VLC Media Player, etc.. The only complaint is the trackpad which is a bit sluggish, usually I need to tap more than once with two fingers to get the right-click right, this is something I am not used to, I think I am not tapping hard enough. The touch screen's brightness is only 250 nits, but I only use it indoor, so that is fine. The Chrome browser, the Android apps and the Linux software are found to be snappy overall, this is more than I expected, I think I will use this Chromebook more, and use my Windows desktop less in the future.

I like this but the problem for me is that it's not printer- friendly,"You don't expect much from a $300 chromebook in terms of quality, but this things is very impressive. The all metal build feels very sturdy, as do the hinges. The keyboard is higher quality than most $1000 laptops, and the screen and speakers are much higher quality than I would expect from this price range (you can hear actual bass and get pretty good contrast of dark colors!). The battery lasts for like 8 straight hours of streaming, and the fan noise is usually quiet enough that it isn't noticeable.

The only real problems I've had with it is that it for some reason disagrees with some streaming services, notably Hulu and HBOMax. It behaves weirdly on those sites and playback will fail every few days, forcing a restart. This hasn't happened on any of my other devices, but the same behavior happened on two of these laptops (I got a replacement to check).

,"This chromebook might not meet everyone's needs, but it was just what I wanted! I did a lot of research before buying this specific item.

I wanted something portable, straight forward and affordable. After comparing traditional laptops and chromebooks, I decided a chrombook would fit our needs. Searching the internet, doing my online banking, streaming Netflix, Prime, etc., doing taxes, and helping our daughter with her college applications were on my ""greatest hits"" list of needs. If you have some powerful computing or need mega storage space, then a more traditional laptop might fit your needs more, but for my dollar this one is great. I did outside research on the best chromebooks and this brand popped up at the top of list after list. It was very easy to set up with my current google info (which brought all my info over to the new machine automatically) and the light up keyboard is a nice touch. The speakers could be a bit louder but for the price I paid, I'm fine with it.

Surprisingly high quality for the price,"First and foremost the sale price for this device ($286 with tax came out to $300.72) is just highway robbery! The Flex 5i is to mid-range Chromebooks what the original Chromebook Duet is for affordable (budget end) Chromebooks...the default suggestion & standard bearer.

It may not be the sleekest, most attractive device on the market but what it lacks in appearance it more than makes up for with its specifications. You would be very hard pressed to find a device this versatile and powerful for $300. And in all honesty you really shouldn’t even bother looking anywhere else.

If you are looking for a Chromebook under the $500 price range this is absolutely one of the Chromebooks you should consider. It is an amazing 2-in-1 device with extraordinary power and the functionality is amazing and the only things you will have to come to terms with are that the screen is a bit yellow in tint and that there is no HDMI port on this device and that can be easily solved by using a hub or getting a USB C to HDMI Adapter which at most will cost you $20.

Also for those of you worried about fan noise…in my experience it hardly cuts on but again it probably depends what all you are doing and the type of surface you have this device on.

,"After reading tons of reviews and taking ages to make a decision, I finally decided that I don't need a full PC, and I can totally get by with a Chromebook. The costs are so much lower it's barely a comparison, and though it's kind of like having a really big Android phone in many ways, the value for the money is hard to beat. The cost was pretty low to start with, and I was able to use points from my credit card to carve that in half. Combined with the fact that this was top rated by Wirecutter (NYT, not trying to give them a plug but citing my source) I thought I should just make the call without more delay. Starts instantly, shuts down instantly, controls are intuitive, folds flat nicely, feels solid (though we shall see what happens if my toddler really gets her hands on it), light up keyboard is nice though not critical. I guess I'm a little surprised by the very basic keypad which does not appear to have any extra buttons like Control/Alt, but perhaps those are PC functions that don't apply to Chromebooks? I'm not certain. Machine came shockingly quickly, maybe two days, was fully charged on arrival, and the main thing I really like is that it doesn't constantly, incessantly and frustratingly update the Windows OS. I probably erred when buying my last Dell PC by going a bit cheap and cheerful on the computing power, but I joked that it was really just a software updating machine that didn't really do much other than download new software (which would slow its performance to a crawl). I really hope I've sidestepped that whole issue with this machine."," January 3, 2023",4.0
Great Value for Everyday Tasks,"At $300, this is a steal. It's not fancy like a Mac nor small and slim like the Dell XPS. But it's lightweight and a very comfortable keyboard.

Yes, it's Chromebook, so there might be limits on what you can do, so know that before going in. If all of your work is pretty much done through a browser then this is a perfect setup. Word of advice, if they still have the 256 GB version, get that instead. Larger hard drive is always appreciated if you prefer to have your files kept on the computer.

Only drawback is the keyboard light is always on during bootup. There's no way to default it to off. It's minor, but it does affect battery life a little. However, this issue is with the OS and not the computer. All of my chromebooks with backlit keyboards are the same."," March 20, 2023",4.0

Mid-Range Chromebook That Delivers High-End Satisfaction,"I’ve been using windows based laptops since the early 1990s and they start out reasonably fast but, overtime they get bogged down, slow down, and become frustratingly slow. When it comes to speed of startup, speed when surfing the web, and overall operational speed, this inexpensive little laptop puts all the windows based laptops I’ve owned to shame. You open the lid and it’s ready to go instantly. Touch the chrome browser button and your home page opens instantly. Click or touch links, shortcuts, or bookmarks and they open instantly. I can actually run Microsoft Office online version faster than I can run MS Office that is installed locally on my windows desktop computer. Wow!

So, what’s the catch? You need an internet connection because almost everything about the way a chromebook works is web based. You can’t install most full versions of windows based programs on this computer. You have a huge numbers of apps available from the App Store but, if you require installed full versions of programs that work in places with no internet access than this machine is not the answer.

However, I see this type of system as the future of computing. I could see where a chromebook with cellular (this one is WiFi only) could be ideal in the future as more and more software and information storage becomes entirely or, almost entirely web based. Because you’re not storing huge programs and tons of data on your computer things don’t get bogged down, your machine stays fast, and you are less likely to pick up malware."," January 8, 2023",4.0

It works but has quality issues,"this is my second chromebook (still like my 5 year-old 11.6 inch Asus C202SA 4GB/16GB which is still going strong, but it has reached the end of its automatic OS updates). this one is MUCH faster, has a lot more memory 8GB and storage 128GB, but is also quite a lot heavier (and cost twice as much). i like the tablet mode, too, although i don't have much need for android apps and haven't installed linux. nice screen (though 250 nits is a little low), terrific backlit keyboard. but the battery does not last me more than 5 hours, which is a shame, considering i am only using it for browsing and google docs. turned off bluetooth, which helped a bit. i'm envious of those getting 10-hour battery life. but i'll have to keep the unit because i'm in india and there is no easy way to return it to amazon in the US though i have had it for only one week."," October 8, 2022",5.0
,"People often have a hard time trying to find the perfect laptop, especially people on the budget side of things. So let me put my searching to rest with this review. I researched over 50 Chromebooks trying to find a budget option instead of an old fashioned laptop, and I came across a video discussing some of the best Chromebooks of 2022, which included this model, the Lenovo Thinkpad 5i Chromebook. At first I was skeptical because it didn't have that many review compared to other models and was kinda under the radar. But trust me when I say you need to buy this; after researching for weeks this model, even with it's price tag of $450 (I got it for $350 on sale), it is 100% worth it. The build is solid, the glass screen with 1080pHD display is incredible, the backlit keyboard is flawless in its performance, and the thing runs lightning fast on its up to date ChromeOs, and will have updates until 2029. This thing is a bang for your buck with high quality materials in a budget friendly price point, and I highly recommend this to everyone."," January 16, 2023",5.0
Feature,"I can't speak to specs and such, but just know this is a great upgrade from the ol'skool laptops. Our home computer needs are pretty basic, but until this purchase we were still operating on an old Dell laptop. You know, the ones that took 15 minutes to load since it was over 5 years old. The Chromebook is great for streaming and all our other family needs. I searched numerous articles for computer notebook recommendations and such and this one mentioned often in the mid level range. Thinks there was some hot deal when I purchased which definitely made it worth it. Highly recommend."," March 26, 2023",5.0

Only drawback is the Camera and doesn't come with a stylus pen. Camera isn't good. Need to buy external Camera for better quality. This laptop is a touch screen but doesn't come with a stylus pen.

,"I've only had this for a day but it's a great little Chromebook for getting lite work done. I've yet to try the touchscreen out as I've been using it strictly as a laptop. The battery life is mediocre, depending on what you do. For Google doc editing and article reading with Spotify in the background I was getting about 7 hours. Not bad for a laptop but not great for a Chromebook. It's a bit heavier than other Chromebooks I've tried but still perfectly manageable. The little i3 is pulling its weight in this Chromebook. Everything feels very responsive and I've yet to have any hangups, even when trying it out with multiple 1080p YouTube videos going and several chrome tabs for research. I'm thoroughly impressed.
Overall I would still personally give it 5 stars.
Note: I did order this through Amazon. UPS was very slow to get it from Amazon to my town. They then delivered it to an unknown address and neither UPS or Amazon were helpful at all and the package was never recovered. Amazon did, however, issue a refund and I picked one up locally, albeit at a slightly higher price. Better than dealing with UPS, though."," November 19, 2022",4.0

As a first time Chromebook user and a bit of a tinker, its proven to be more flexible than I thought it would be. I even have Steam installed via the beta OS and it been great for light gaming. I'll eventually mess around with running Linux on it, but its been great so far. It's done everything I've wanted with ease, and the battery life has been great. Biggest knock I have against it is maybe the fact that the brightness could be better. But overall for the money, it's a great little machine.

Does Everything I Need!,"Update: I worked with Netflix and they updated their app to support this model! I've upped my review to 5 stars as the hardware itself is stellar. I'm still disappointed Lenovo didn't do the footwork themselves to ensure compatibility with the most popular apps. But all is well that ends well.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I love the specs and quality of the Flex 5i. However, I'm very disappointed Lenovo didn't work with Netflix to ensure compatibility with their hardware. As of 11/29/22, Netflix cannot be downloaded from the PlayStore. I can sideload the APK in dev mode, but the app says it's not compatible and quits. Admittedly this is a Netflix problem, but we live in a highly connected world - I would certainly hope Lenovo is doing compatibility testing with major apps like other manufacturers do?! From a hardware standpoint alone, this is a 5 star product"," November 30, 2022",5.0
,"The main reason that I get this device is config: intel CPU, 8Gb RAM and 128Gb storage. I don't find other (at least in Amazon) has this price range around $300. I am a heavy tab user, so I need RAM. I need the linux environment, so I need RAM and storage size. Having an interl (or maybe x86) CPU also helps me escape from some potential compatibility issues of ARM processors when doing linux stuff.

To be honest, the touchpad is not great (which helps me adapt to the touchscreen), the keyboard is ok, the screen is a little bit blue (but the night mode is too orange), the fans sometime are noisy. However, this price with intel CPU, 8Gb RAM and 128 Gb storage is great."," December 30, 2022",5.0

My only negative by comparison is the display, but I knew that before purchasing. Nothing can compete with the 2K, 400+ nit, 3:2, on the 713 Spin. The display on the Flex is plenty responsive to touch, but the colors are a bit subdued and I am constantly wanting more brightness. In time, I hope to get used to it. The battery is fine.

I reached out to the Company Lenovo to get it fixed or replaced with the warranty you get when you buy this. But...that warranty does not cover damage - even if it was not your fault and you used the machine properly. They will not fix it under warranty and will send you to get it fixed and you have to pay for the product to be fixed. Even though it is less than two months old - has never been misused or dropped and basically they sold me a product that was not well made. Knowingly, they provide a warranty that does not cover this nor can you even upgrade the warranty to do so.

Cons - the computer wouldn't turn on suddenly 3 months after we received it. We had to send it to Lenovo for servicing. They were not easy to work with. It was very hard to get through on any of the service numbers they gave and we got bounced around a lot. They created a service ticket but I had to call multiple times to get a shipping label because we didn't even know where to send it. They did fix it quickly, but never said what was actually wrong. I'm hoping it doesn't happen again.

The other thing to note is that the warranty starts from the date the computer was built - not the day you receive it. So our warranty was almost up after just 3 months."," June 26, 2023",5.0

,"Beautiful computer. When I change the resolution a video is very clear with no lags. BUT, the main thing I use my Chromebooks for is the tablet feature. When in tablet mode, it gets very hot because you are blocking all the air vents when you fold it like that! It almost sounded like a fan that is running loudly and it gets very warm, even on a table. I tried not quite folding it all the way over but then it was difficult to use.

Battery drains fast. This a.m. I did just basic surfing and checking email and was very unhappy with how quickly it drained.

And last, apps. The main reason I love my current Chromebook is the convenience of apps. With the Lenovo Chromebook the apps are sized way too small and don’t adapt to screen size. My favorite coloring app opens to only the size of a phone! I might as well just use it on my phone then, right? When that same app is used in tablet mode, it is distorted. The same with a card game app, it sizes small too and is unusable in tablet or regular mode.

,"It looks great, it feels great, its well priced. I was so excited when I first unbox this device.

After 7 months of use - I can say almost each work + entertainment session has been frustrating on this chromebook.

The app store is completely broken. It doesn't upon EVER and is stuck in a spinning circle. I have to restart my laptop 1-2x every single time I want to open the playstore.

Even more - this same issue is present on EVERY SINGLE app I have used on this chromebook.

I click Spotify, amazon video, netflix - the app doesn't open and spins incessantly unless I hard restart my chromebook once or twice.

The netflix app maxes out at 480p standard definition - HD is not compatible with this chromebook.

I try viewing Netflix, amazon, HBO shows from the browser because the apps are so broken - i receive ""playback"" error messages in the middle of tv shows, movies every 15-20 minutes that also requires a hard restart to fix.

Literally nothing on this chromebook functions as it should and when it does - I'm extremely surprised.

I can't even return this junk at this point and instead gifted it to a 11 year old niece for her school activities since she is not allowed to watch shows anyways.

If you're looking for a work/play hybrid laptop - this one ABSOLUTELY STINKS AND FAILS MISERABLY FOR PLAYING MUSIC, TV SHOWS, and MOVIES.

Its dysfunctional video/app functionablity is so bad I won't even complain about the horrible battery life, the super low speakers, and cheap feeling plastic base compared to the heavy, metallic screen.

Normally I would be complacent as ""you get what you pay for"" but my 200$ lenovo laptop functions 10x better than this garbage and is 10x as reliable.

Using this laptop to watch my favorite show or movie feels like using a 1998 Windows laptop to run complex video games - you don't know when it will/wont work, and the few times it does work feels like a blessing.

,"This is a review from a blindness prospective.
Build: I feel like this computers build is very nice. It is quite thin and light. I like the feel of the keyboard. The machine doesn't run hot which is really a plus.
Layout: ON the right top above the keyboard pannel is the power buttonKeyboard The computer is set to auto power up when you open the lid so if you hit the power button you may turn off the computer. You can change this in Lenovo software.
there are no other buttons above the keyboard.
Power jack is on the top left.
a USB a port, HDMI, USB C port, and headset jack down the left side.
UsB A, and card reader down the right side. The SD card doesn't go all the way in the body of the laptop so you can't leave it in for storage.
Keyboard: f keys are mapped as media keys out of the box. You should go into the Lenovo software to put them back to f keys if you are a screen reader user. This is accessible with both JAWS and narorator.
There is no applications key.
Volume down and up are fn+f2 or f3.
The arrow keys are not in a T shape but you can differinciate them on the keyboard.
Sound/Speakers: Good quality honestly. Better than I expected. No your not going to listen to music out of them, but they are more than fine for a screen reader. Internal microphone is surprisingly good if you disable the processing in the sound settings.
The machine has two drives internal. Your OS and software instals are on a 128 GB, and there is a seperate data drive which is really nice. The data drive comes empty. It is the d: drive out of the box.
The computer is quick plugged into a/c power, files copy quick navigation is quick. It is hardly navigateable on battery out of the box. It was quite shocking. I went into the power settings and cranked the processer up to 100% which helped a little? I then went to run and msconfig and quit a lot of software that I didn't need running. That helped some as well. I then turned off ""Sharky"" on JAWS 2023 which is the hands free assistant. This really quickened things up for me as a screen reader user. Now it is running smoothe. A/C Power is still quicker and if you are sighted you may have access to the bios and be able to make some settings changes there to.

All and all I am happy with the machine. For the money it is amazing. I have a 2 GB SSD and 20 GB ram and that is pretty sweet. I am guessing the processer is where this computer may fall short for some benchmarks."," May 6, 2023",5.0

,"Edit: This was originally a five-star review. I'm still really happy with my purchase, but I ran into stuttering on YouTube videos and unimpressive/inconsistent download times that I couldn't seem to fix. Come to find out the wifi cards that come preinstalled on these laptops leave something to be desired. This isn't a big deal if you have an ethernet cable handy, but it would likely be a massive pain for anyone meaning to, say, write an essay at a coffee shop.

I swapped out the wifi card in my old laptop for the one in this one and it works flawlessly. I can't vouch for it, but I've read Intel's AX200NGW wifi card is a good replacement for the one that comes stock in these machines. If you're going to be adding RAM or an extra HDD anyway, swapping out the wifi card isn't too difficult; the tiny connectors are just really finicky. I could live with the wifi as it was, but I don't have access to a wired connection as much as I'd like. If that's you, be prepared for a bit of tinkering.

Everything else I said stands.

Edit 2: Elden Ring runs great on this.

----

I paid a little under $750 for this laptop. Out the gate, I added 32GB of RAM, which cost me around $150. That's overkill - 16GB is perfectly serviceable on this configuration, especially without a secondary SSD, and 16GB would cost roughly half that. I wanted to future proof my purchase and make it simple to switch out my secondary mechanical drive in the future.

I would absolutely recommend swapping the RAM for two 16GB sticks (you want them to be the same variety to get the most performance and bang for your buck) and the 8GB my model came with is only just enough for Windows at this point. If you only intend to run Steam and some games, it might do. If you have a Chromium-based web browser running in the background, forget about it. Trust me - extra RAM will save you a lot of headache.

My model didn't come with easy access panels on the back for adding an HDD or for changing out the RAM. Luckily the screws are fairly easy to remove, and the panel came off pretty easily with a plastic pry tool. (Amazon sells the kit I use - it's really handy to have on hand in case you ever need to get inside your machine. Search ""Syntus Electronic Repair Tool Kit with Magnetic Driver Kit, 80 in 1 Professional Precision Screwdriver Set with Portable Pouch for iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Gaming Console, Controller, Black"")

There's two M.2 slots and one SATA slot. I wouldn't recommend mounting a second M.2 drive - one, I'm not sure how you'd safely mount it in this revision. Two, if you watch Linus Tech Tips video on the performance difference between a SATA SSD and M.2 drives, you'll see that the average user isn't going to notice a difference between the two types of SSDs. Frankly, my 7200rpm mechanical drive loads things really quickly on this laptop, so I'm not even in a rush to upgrade from that. Games like The Witcher 3 run perfectly fine off of it. (And honestly, if you're on a budget and don't want to deck out this laptop with the best kit it can handle, 2TB 7200rpm mechanical drives can be had for around $40-$80 these days.)

The build quality is fantastic. You can tell which parts of it are a little cheaper than others - I'd be careful with the plastic tabs when you're prying the bottom off; take your time with it - but it feels solid the moment you take it out the box. The back of the IPS panel is mounted to metal. The bezels are designed such that it's entirely feasible for you, as the user, to open up and work on your own hardware. From a right-to-repair standpoint, this machine is as good as it gets in this price range. Even if you have no interest in working on it or ever opening it up, you can take it to a local computer shop and be rest assured they can easily get to whatever they need to work on.

The screen is the part most likely to fail on a laptop over extended use. I haven't cracked open the bezel on my unit because my screen was in perfect working order and after a nightmare I had with a different laptop, I just wanted to get back to using my computer. Looking up tutorials and images online, every model of this computer I've seen uses screws to hold the screen in place. No glue or anything like that. In the event that you or a technician ever needs to swap out the screen for a different one, it should be a fairly simple process.

And again I return to build quality - I've noticed very little light bleed when I'm running various applications. This is not the best ips panel I have ever used, but let me stress again - for the price? It's amazing. High refresh rate. Everything is crystal clear. Good contrast. It's been a joy to do photo editing work on it.

For gaming - I use Linux as my daily driver, and removed Windows from this device as soon as I got it set up and made sure there weren't any malfunctions or defects that would warrant calling the manufacturer or returning it to Amazon.

If you're curious whether this makes a good Linux machine - yes, with some caveats. My model - 15ACH6 - did not have working wifi out of the box in Pop OS or Manjaro.

I initially wanted to use Pop OS because it has great hybrid graphics support (better than Windows, if you ask me) and it comes pre-packed with tools to help maximize your laptop's battery life. However, making the wifi work wasn't a simple fix. There are several methods; the least complicated one for me was upgrading the kernel. Problem is - Pop OS is an Ubuntu-based OS and isn't designed to have the kernel upgraded independent of the operating system.

Long story short - I got Pop OS working perfectly, but getting the kernel upgraded was just the first issue I had to solve. I also had to change the power management settings so my wifi wasn't throttled, and my printer was detected but wasn't working properly out of the box.

Manjaro makes it easy to upgrade the kernel, and I was up and running within an hour. The thing that took the longest was waiting for all the updates to install. The only thing I had to do to make full use of my hardware was update the Nvidia drivers, manually install the Optimus Switcher (look up ""How to setup Optimus Manager on Manjaro! | DenshiHelp"" on YouTube, especially if you use KDE) and adjust the power management settings.

If you're a Linux user or you're Linux-curious, Manjaro is your best bet on this thing if you want a relatively painless experience. (This is also why I bought so much RAM - if I absolutely have to use Windows for any reason, I want the extra memory to run a VM.)

Mind, this shouldn't be an issue in the future. The latest version of Pop OS at the time of this writing is 21.10. If you get this same model of this laptop and newer revisions of the major Linux operating systems have been released, it should be a fairly seamless experience regardless of which one you choose.

I also want to note - in terms of getting this laptop to boot from USB, this was by far the most painless experience I've had. Any other laptop I've had has fought me tooth and nail when I wanted to remove Windows and install Linux. Part of that's the AMD architecture - in my experience, AMD respects their users more than Intel or Nvidia does, so if that's important to you, this is a great machine. If you've ever heard of Intel's Management Engine, AMD's equivalent - the PSP - can be just be switched off in the BIOS. Not once has this machine tried to tell me - its owner and end user - what I can and cannot do with it.

But back to gaming - I didn't try to run anything on Windows, but I can tell you just from the hardware specs you're going to have a great experience with anything released from 2018-2020, and the GTX 1650 would be a respectable graphics card even in a desktop at this point thanks to the current market. You most likely won't be running a game released in 2022 on Ultra on this laptop, but you should be able to get admirable performance on medium-to-high settings running something that just released.

On Linux running Proton - The Witcher 3 runs flawlessly for me on the highest settings using the current experimental version of Proton through Steam. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, runs flawlessly. All the indie and retro-style platformers I threw at it - Cuphead, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon, Blaster Master Zero - flawless. Streets of Rage 4, Mother Russia Bleeds, Terraria, Celeste, Knights of the Old Republic 2 - those are Linux native so they ran for me as well as they do in Windows. Most of your older RPGs like Fallout: New Vegas and Morrowind will run amazingly on here regardless of what OS you're using.

I won't sugarcoat it and tell you that gaming on Linux is every bit as good as gaming on Windows. It's not. If you want to play the latest multiplayer games with your friends or you like to hop around and try different games when they come out without having to check if they work and without having to tinker, keep Windows on this machine.

For me - I have always been about 5 years behind the curve, my favorite games are in 2D, and I refuse to play games with excessive DRM (here's looking at you, Denuvo) or invasive anti-cheat (that is a security timebomb waiting to go off) so my experience switching from Windows to Linux has been relatively painless as a gamer. Valve's Proton is at a great place right now, and if you look up anything that's Steam Deck verified you should have a good time. You've got hundreds - if not thousands - of games at your disposal regardless of what kind of OS you're running.

To end this off - I am in love with this laptop, and I would gladly get another Lenovo machine in the future. The 8 gigs of RAM it came with is a little lean, but it's an easy upgrade, and you will definitely want to add a harddrive anyway. The IO is a little lacking at a mere two USB 3.0 ports, but - they're both USB 3, and you can attach a USB hub. (Just don't run an external HDD off it as most USB hubs don't draw additional power from the slot.)

The build quality is rock solid. The specs are respectable enough that it will breathe new life into your older games and allow you to play most newer titles. You can easily do photo and video editing on this. It's set up to be easy to clean, maintenance, and repair. All in all, for less than $800? This thing is a steal."," February 22, 2022",5.0
An incredibly impressive machine for the price,"Quality feel, responsive and easy to upgrade. I don't play a lot of demanding titles, but this pc preforms well in games like WOW, Minecraft Dungeons, ESO and Genshin. It works nicely for office work and other media consumption as well.

Pros:

Keyboard has a nice tactile response, and the typing experience is enjoyable even if a little truncated. That is to say that the 10 key (numbers pad) is a bit on the smaller side. It feels natural after a few hours of typing. It is backlit which is also nice.

The screen, to me, is more than bright enough and the colors are vibrant. Not as good as my desktop monitor but way better than any of my budget media/office laptops.

It was very easy to upgrade as well. Included the bracket, connector, and screws to mount a 2.5 inch drive.

Cons:

There is a lack of ports, which I knew when I bought it and is not a deal breaker but is worth mentioning. Two usb a (3rd gen), one usb c (data only), an hdmi, a combo audio jack and a proprietary power port. A third usb a (even if only 2.0) would have been nice, on the opposing/lefthand side as would a car reader. I also don't understand the lack of usb c charging in this day and age but that seems to be a common issue with gaming laptops (at many price points) so I would hold that against it.

It did not include a standoff of adding a second M.2 NVME even though there is a slot for it. Not the end of the world but odd, nonetheless.

Battery life is nonexistent. 2-3 hours of mixed use and less than an hour when gaming.

Overall:

I must say that I am happy so far. As I said, it was easy to upgrade and is quite responsive both in office work and at gaming. If what you are looking for is portable gaming setup, this might be for you. Or you want to do some light media editing. It also does office/schoolwork and media consumption well, as it should. Makes a great alternative to trying to buy a graphics card for your desktop at the moment too.

Quality seems to be there; it is your use case that will decide if this pc is for you. Want a portable gaming setup that can do office/schoolwork, some light editing and media consumption? Then this might be for you. On the other hand, if you want a work/school pc that can game on the side I might look for something with good integrated graphics that is lighter and has better battery life. That call is going to be on you.

As long as you understand what you are buying, I think you will be happy with this laptop. I know I am."," February 3, 2022",5.0

Good cheap laptop,"I bought this laptop only so I could play the Sims 4. I've always wanted to try a gaming laptop, and since the Sims is the only game I play I figured the Lenovo Ideapad would work well, and it wasn't too expensive. I've pretty much always played the Sims on just regular laptops, so my main hope was that the battery life on this gaming laptop would be better than my old laptops. Unfortunately, those hopes were in vain.

Once the Ideapad was fully charged, I downloaded the Sims and left the settings on Ultra when I played just to see how the laptop would do. I got less than an hour of game play before I had to plug it in, which, while disappointing, I kind of expected because the Ultra settings are pretty high. So I stopped the game, let the laptop charge, and when it was done I turned on Battery Saver to Always On and lowered the settings in the Sims 4. These are the same things I did on the HP Pavilion I used to play on, and that extended my unplugged battery life to about 3 hours while playing the Sims 4.

However, when I did these same settings for the Ideapad, I got ONE hour of unplugged game play. One. Now, I understand that gaming laptops with Lithium-polymer or Lithium-ion batteries can be used while they are charging without harming the battery, but isn't one hour still a bit low for a gaming laptop? I'm not an expert on them so I don't know, but I was disappointed. There are some other general things about the laptop I don't like, like the volume/brightness control buttons, but the battery was my main issue. I'm pretty sure I'll be returning this for my money back. It's just not for me."," December 4, 2022",5.0

I have not tried it for games but my guess it will drain the battery very quickly. On amazon the reviews noted that this laptop comes with 135W power supply (I was a little worried that it may not provide enough juice) but in the box I got a 170W power which works great.

The screen is not suitable for outdoor work
nor for editing photos due to low color gamut/ rgb coverage.

I think it is better to buy this model with a rtx3050ti and a 512gb ssd for 80$ more..
And on the way order another 8gb of ram (ddr4 3200 cl22 for laptop)

,This laptop is pretty decent for the money. The gaming performance is good if you play certain games. I'm still currently testing games and so far each game runs about 60 Fps with games on Low to medium settings (Again depending on what games you play). But I would say this laptop is good for Casual gamers. But the first thing I would recommend is to upgrade the RAM and hard drive and you're good to go. But the laptops battery life is really weak it can only last up to 1 hour of gameplay and most games are capped at 30fps running only on battery power.

Good Gaming Laptop with some cons.,It’s a decent laptop but it has its flaws. Tends to randomly freeze while playing. Most of the time my game would freeze and I can’t even minimize the game so the only way to get out is to restart the laptop.

,"This laptop is great. Some of my favorite parts are the 120hz display, the backlit keyboard, and the performance overall. The only things I wish were a little better are the battery life (probably around 4hrs of browsing with the backlit keyboard on) and the 8gb of ram. The ram is upgradable to 16gb though so that is a choice and the battery was probably a compromise that had to take place in order to have the 120hz display. If you use this laptop plugged in, you should have a pretty seamless experience. Last thing is that I appreciate how they didn't remove buttons such as the number pad, caps lock, etc. It's something you don't notice until it's not there."," December 19, 2021",5.0

- Constant crashes ""out of memory.""

But I'm not even sure you can remove the battery on this unit.
The second thing that really makes this a joke is that you have to have internet connection just to sign into your Microsoft account. I'm not talking about using any form of Internet. It just requires internet connection to function. I don't know if that's windows 11 or the laptop. I don't really care.

It also feels ""depressing"" - it affects my mood. There are ways to change the display to cooler shades or warmer shades but to my eyes, the options look worse than the factory color tones. Maybe this can be corrected, but my Lenovo Yoga looked great right out of the box. This Lenovo Ideapad3 does not. I think some of the problem has to do with the angle the screen is opened to. The image fades or deepens, deepening upon the angle you are viewing the screen from. My Yoga is not this sensitive, and the screen has a sharper image. That's my only complaint.

Also, the brightness when plugged in is significantly brighter than when it is not plugged in.

Since the battery is not replaceable, I was concerned, and contacted Lenovo support. I spoke to two different support people, and they both advised me to return the laptop.

,"Lenovo Warranty

I purchased a Legion 5i (17”) with GTX 1660 Ti 81Y80005 US for $1,209.46, so it wasn’t a cheap laptop by any means. Within 6 months the blue screen of death occurred the laptop would not start up. When I bought the laptop Lenovo’s PREMIER service support came with the machine. I contacted Lenovo’s PREMIER service support.
The PREMIER service support agent told me I needed to pack up the laptop and send it to them for repairs. I asked for my money back since this happened so early in the life span of the laptop, I was denied. I asked for a new laptop, again I was denied. I was told there was nothing their PREMIER service could do and to send the laptop back to Lenovo. Anything but PREMIER service.
I am a disabled Vet on a fixed income with my spouse who is also disabled. We use the laptop daily for medical appointments, ordering medicine, bills, ect. We lost all that information.
I contacted Lenovo PREMIER service once again. This time I got someone on the phone who decided to help me make a restore usb image. I did this on a dell backup laptop that is 10 years old and still works, that laptop replaced a dell laptop that was out of warranty but dell replaced it. It took two days to get this laptop running. But a least I got someone who was willing to help. I guess willing is PREMIER service.
I spent over 1,200 on a machine that crashed within 6mo. I again requested my money back or a new machine, both denied. I was denied help, until I persisted. I then asked PREMIER service for a warranty extension since I have lost confidence this laptop will last. I was sent an email asking why I needed an extension on my warranty, I explained basically what I have explained here. I was offered a 30-day Warranty extension. 30 days is a slap in the face Lenovo PRIEMIER service.
I have bought office chairs, hue lights, tablet all from Lenovo. This is the first time I have has to use Lenovo’s warranty service. I will not purchase anything else from Lenovo because all is fine until you need support. Or in my case lack of it. Do not buy products from Lenovo. There isn’t any support if it goes bad. PREMIER service or lack of any service. Thank you Lenovo PREMIER service for the 30 day warranty extension After all my purchase’s and my $1,200 purchase that crashed within 6mo. STAY AWAY, STAY CLEAR of purchasing anything from LENOVO."," June 29, 2022",5.0

,"Fast processor (Ryzen 5) and SSD. Fast wifi. Would prefer one more USB and also an easy way to add a second SSD without taking the screws out (they could just put a cover on the bottom to access it). Large 17” screen- clear and bright but the description before I ordered was somewhat misleading on a few things.

Depending on what exact model you get, you may not get a backlit keyboard which is one reason I got this thinking the model I got had a backlit keyboard which it did not.

I also am not too crazy about all the Lenovo software they preloaded on here (most of it I removed) but then not even a year of anti virus? C’mon! I know the price is low for a reason but surely Lenovo can obtain some sort of deal on that.

It’s a good laptop overall and will do well for most people in most tasks. I only wish I had gone up 8 more GB on the ram as I find I run more stuff on it at the same time than I initially thought I would. Good computer for under $500 especially for the screen size and speed."," May 14, 2023",4.0
Good but a few caveats..,I did not really like this laptop but I gave it five stars because for the price I paid of $380 it was beyond anything anyone could expect. The 17-in screen is large and perfectly fine. The laptop itself is thin and light for a 17-in laptop and looks really good. The memory is very easy to upgrade and you can get it to 40 GB if you pay $75 or so for a 32 GB dimm to put in there. But the idea that this is a six core chip is really deceptive. I mean I guess the technically has six scores but it behaves like an Intel four core laptop chip from 4 years ago. I think they don't give the chip enough power or something I don't know to save battery maybe? but don't think that you're going to get the same performance that you would get from a current desktop AMD ryzen 6 core chip. it's not going to be the same at all.," April 19, 2023",4.0

1 year later (bought in 2021)

Windows 11 is a buggy mess
It says it can be used for gaming, but simple stuff makes it freeze.
And of course the weird need to use Lenovo's app.

I have an 8 years old Toshiba that did way better in 6 year than this thing did in 6 months. There's no crashes either, just straight freeze or lags, and then you're there trying to figure out if you need to hit power or not.

One of the updates broke the casting feature, something I use a lot, and upon trying any form of update, down grade or anything has left this in a mess. Also the freezing while doing any of this.

And lastly factory reset the thing, so the little feature works, but only for it to tell me that my windows is not activated so I can personalize my laptop.

Then performance slowed to crawl. I had bought BestBuy TotalTech policy. Took it in...thought I had virus or sometihing. Their analysis: ""After running diagnostics on your laptop, we found that the reason it performs slowly is due to it having a hard drive. Hard drives are slower and run physically with a fan and tend to degrade over time, thus slowing your computer. We recommend that you upgrade to a solid state drive (SSD), they are faster, more durable, and would noticeably speed up your system. Since there is an open slot for an SSD, we can install one and use the hard drive as a secondary drive or replace the hard drive entirely."" Bought new SSD drive from BB $75. Works OK now. My only thought is what a gyp. I'm not Pc hw person. Didn't look close enough to realize it was hard drive. But even I know SSD drives way to go. That's what I get for being stupid.

,I like the build quality and the size of it. The screen is clear and sharp but would like it to be a little bit brighter. The battery life is okay - not excellent. I like the finger print reader. The touch screen works very well. I am happy with the purchase of this laptop.," March 29, 2023",5.0
Quick and well made laptop.,"I got this laptop as an IT student to do coding, studying, and some IT projects. Also the touch screen was a draw to me for reading and things like that. This laptop has definitely exceeded my expectations. My old laptop was an acre aspire with an dedicated Nvidia GPU, but this laptop blows that one out of the water.

I’m not a gamer but I played GTA V and Skyrim on high settings with no lag what so ever. My old laptop could barley handle medium low graphics. So to me that tells me if this laptop can handle a complex game like GTA V on near full settings, it can definitely handle other graphics intensive applications no problem.

I also have Ubuntu installed alongside Windows and it boots insanely fast (like 5 seconds after pressing power).

This is my first AMD chip laptop and touch screen one and it’s been great so far.

The screen is also beautiful and big enough for my needs. I’m glad I took a chance on it.

However, there was a ton of bloat ware/ free apps I had to un install and also a lot of startup apps Windows 11 likes to include. After removing those it’s boots and performs faster. Also, there are a ton of things you can do with the Lenovo Vantage app. Such as conservation mode on the battery (which is recommended if you keep it plugged in a lot)."," February 26, 2023",5.0
,"So the computer itself looks nice. And it has a pencil that comes with it which is also nice. It has a fingerprint reader, which is also nice. But I don’t know where the power went to. I charge it to 100% and then shut it down and then the next day when I turned it on it was at 50%. It said I had 1 hour and 27 minutes left to the battery life. And I didn’t do anything overnight with, so I’m questioning where the power went to? So as I said, it has a fingerprint reader, but every time I turn it on spin, asking me to enter a pin number or password. If I have a fingerprint reader, that should be one of the options initially. I did set it up with my fingerprint before going through all that other things about the password. It’s a good enough computer. It just has some quirks. And all the time is asking me to put in a McAfee subscription or to buy one. I can’t tell you how many fake emails I get every day about some McAfee subscription or some Norton thing I don’t really know who to trust. So that’s kind of annoying. But I did buy it to replace an older computer and it has done that."," March 13, 2023",5.0
Great laptop for school!,"To clarify, I have the 16GB RAM/512GB SSD/ Ryzen 5 5500U model. The battery life, camera quality, touch screen, and the power of this laptop are exactly what they should be for this price range. The speed and power of the laptop is what has impressed me the most. I am a music producer and I need at least 16GB of Ram and the 512GB of storage is pretty good as well. I also like to game a little. I was able to download and install over 60GB of musical software, which would usually take me a whole day or two to fully set up, in about 30 minutes. I am able to play Fortnite at around 30-40 fps, Valorant at around 60-80 fps, and Minecraft at around 60+ fps, which is plenty for my own needs right now, as I mostly use it for music production. So far it runs everything I bought it for smoothly and has at least met, if not exceeded my expectations. After reading many of the worse reviews, I tried to prepare myself for some flaws, but I honestly like everything about it. The brightness isn’t as bad as some people say either, 250 nits on this display is honestly plenty for probably 90% of the situations I use it in. Even if there is sunlight, I can still see the screen enough. It’s not like I’ll be gaming in the sunlight, if anything doing a musical performance outside during the day would potentially be a challenge but not impossible. Overall if you are someone who needs a good laptop for a good price, this really is a good choice. It’s my first time using Lenovo as I have used HP for 8+ years.

Great laptop with a touch screen.,"After six years, my old laptop was finally ready to go--I picked this one on recommendation from a friend who had a slightly older model. I'm VERY impressed with this computer so far. The battery life is the best I've had since my college computer, even if I'm on YouTube or drawing, the touch screen is pretty responsive (I've noticed that the top half-centimeter doesn't seem to respond, but that's consistent so I think it's supposed to be that way) and the touch controls are very sensible. The sound is good; I haven't had a chance to try the microphone or video yet. The camera seems fine, though! I love that the computer folds for drawing, too.

The only things I don't love are things that have changed between Microsoft 10 and 11, but that's not on the Lenovo. It automatically put OneDrive on (yuck) and some of the functionality of the apps have changed between operating systems. Again, though, nothing major, and that's not on Lenovo. I'm just getting used to them!

Overall, I think this was a great purchase. I'm very happy with this Lenovo so far."," December 27, 2022",5.0

I thought I didn't need such a high grade laptop. So I decided to get this one, and it's almost half the cost. Im not a gamer on PC, but this also comes with entice gamer pluses, including Xbox promotion time. I periodically watch movies mostly pay bills, read and writing docs. For personal use, I am please with laptop. It is fast, smooth has sufficient memory. Graphics are great, touch screen works great, and so does touch point, even has backlit. It comes with with windows 11 home, Great for me. I transfer all my docs and pdf, photos, music, and some apps. with Lenovo migration assist, so easily through my wifi.

In my case, it lasts around 6-8 hours. Of course it depends on what kind of programs you use. Nevertheless, charging the device is quick (less than an hour, from my experience).

I still recommend this PC. Good for those who are looking for a budget laptop less than $1000 with good specs."," February 19, 2023",3.0

A fast software,"Computer shuts down and is difficult to force restart. One of the USB hubs does not work. Service has been the WORST. They told me to take it to Geek Squad, but after making an appointment, going there and waiting in line, Geek Squad said they won't service it since I did not buy it at Best Buy. I then called Lenovo back and they said, ""take it to Geek Squad."" I asked for a supervisor and eventually he said he'd send a technician to my house. I waited all day on the appointed day and got a call from the supervisor saying it would happen the next day. Took off the morning of the next day and no show. Account showed ""waiting for parts."" Called and spent another half hour talking to Lenovo ""support"" and was told the technicians need to receive the right parts before they do the call so the technician is ""waiting for parts"" and will call to schedule. So why was I told there was a scheduled appointment already? The other option is to send my computer away for at least 10 days with no replacement offered.

HORRIBLE SERVICE,"Yesterday, I turned on my Lenovo Flex 5 Laptop and opened my email account, and this happened. This wonderful laptop continued to delete all my active emails. I use my mousse and don't touch the keyboard unless to type. The factory upper keys or the functions keys are out of alignment and appear to wiggle in appearance. Beware don't let this happen to you. If only I could have recovered my lost emails. I switched to another outlook folder, and the laptop continued to delete them all as fast as it could. Moved to the next folder and every page I switched to, the Lenovo just keep on deleting the contents. What a nightmare. Even when I switched to the trash bin, I saw my files disappear forever. Gone forever! My only recourse was to turn the thing off.
The worst mistake I ever made with this laptop was not to buy a Warranty program for this device. I would have sent this thing back forever. I trusted the name. No More. AND FOEVER.

The laptop performs well.
First disadvantage, the power cable that came with the laptop connects through the only USB Type-C port, even though the laptop comes with a dedicated power port.
My daughter have used it for university for two years and a half. Two weeks ago, the USB Type-C port does not work. I had to buy a power cable that connects to the dedicated power port to be able to charge the laptop.
On Sunday afternoon, I decide to check the Lenovo site to see if there were updated drivers. Among the 13 recommended drivers updates there was a bios update. I followed the instructions and applied the update to the bios.
The laptop rebooted and started to flash the bios and then went black. Windows did not boot up and it never booted again!
Not only that, but the bios update was so faulty that it bricked my daughter's laptop. Every time I turn on the laptop, nothing shows up on video. Can not even get to the BIOS with the special side button. Complete disaster. And because the laptop is out of warranty, There is a charge of $109 for a Lenovo technician to work on it plus shipping plus any other parts that it may require.

If plugged in though, after maxing out its settings for performance it can actually run most games on low or medium pretty well. All in all it ran the majority of Games better than I expected for an entirely non-gaming laptop. If your desperate, this can run many things on low settings enough for them to be playable.
Here's a list of games that run:
-Rainbow Six Siege (runs almost too well)
-Space Engineers (on medium with some low settings at around 50-ish fps)
-League of legends (runs fine as expected)
-Paladins (runs fine as expected)
-Minecraft (including running with Optifine shaders on lower settings)

-EVE Online (runs fine as expected)

The battery life, sadly, was sub par for me. Even keeping the screen brightness turned down to no more than middle of the road, I couldn't really get much more than 3 or maaaaaybe 4 hours. I tinkered with settings to try to help the issue, but in this day and age, I feel like I shouldn't have to reduce everything to the bare, bare minimum to squeeze out 4 hours of battery life. Not when I can get a full day of use on my other laptops without charging.

I did have some Windows 11 glitches with it (several times it wouldn't let me log-in with fingerprint but it also wouldn't let me log in with my pin either and I'd have to reboot), but that's par for the course and hopefully as updates come out, those will be corrected. And that's operating system stuff, not a hardware issue. I'm only pointing it out for people who might be buying this laptop for someone who would find issues like that particularly frustrating.

If you need a solid laptop for light use, you're not going to be too mobile with it, and it'll be mainly plugged in, this is a decent everyday budget laptop. If you need something with more robust battery life, however, this may not be the best choice for you."," August 18, 2022",5.0

Ok for the price,"Esta es una computadora que yo me la compré más que todo para hacer video edición, y en lo que respecta a tareas básicas de video edición cómo cortar y pegar videos los puede manejar muy bien hasta una resolución de 1080p pero ya al entrar al territorio de 4k está computadora requiere de realizar proxys, El GPU integrado tiene una memoria virtual de 4 gb, Por lo cual video editar con esta computadora y realizar efectos especiales y composiciones gráficas es un poco más difícil y tedioso. Les recomendaría irse por una computadora que tenga una tarjeta gráfica integrada tipo nvidia rtx o radeon RX.

Ahora esta es una computadora excelente para toda persona que se dedica a trabajos de oficina por ejemplo escritura Excel Powerpoint etcétera además de tener una muy buena duración de batería puesto que a veces puede durarme hasta 6 o incluso más sin tener que cargarla, una vez en modo ecológico duró hasta casi 9 horas de uso.

Es una buena computadora PERO...,"I bought this while convalescing from open-heart surgery away from home, mainly to handle the large quantity of e-mail newsletters I receive daily.

Processor is more powerful than most users will need, but I like having extra processing power. Only 3.5 pounds, it's easy to move from room to room.

Biggest downside is the somewhat small 250GB SSD, but even that is more than most people who consider this laptop would ever need. I plan on outfitting it with an external HDD or SSD if/when such becomes necessary.

They never mentioned this, but it even supports AMD FreeSync! I'm very surprised to see that a laptop at just $450 is so feature-rich. My only complaint is that the laptop is a fingerprint magnet, if you have bright light shining on it you will see the fingerprints very clearly. Not something I'd knock out a star for, since it doesn't bother me much. Other than that, It's processor is nice, graphics card is nice, and RAM is good. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but the most notable games I tried are Roblox and Minecraft, which both ran smoothly at expected 60 FPS.

,"This review is for the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 Laptop, 14.0"" FHD Display, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage, AMD Radeon 7 Graphics

This laptop is great. The SSD assures fast booting. The graphics card is integrated so it may struggle with certain programs that require a dedicated graphics card for heavy rendering like After Effects or Blender. I upgraded the RAM to 20gb (16gb Crucial sodimm + 4gb soldered) some of which is used by the graphics card. Lightroom works well. The ports are a great. It is lightweight. This is a great laptop for a student or professional who doesn’t need powerful rendering capabilities. It is a secondary laptop to my HP Omen. The Omen is more powerful but sometimes too bulky to carry around for personal use at a coffee shop. This laptop is impressive for $480 plus the Crucial RAM upgrade."," March 21, 2022",4.0

Great little workstation,"This review is written having owned and used this laptop a month-and-a-half. Full Disclosure: I didn't even boot Windows 11, I wiped it immediately and installed Ubuntu (22.04), my OS of choice for a decade

I cheaped out on my last couple laptops ($200-250) and needed something with decent specs this time. Searched for something with a Ryzen processor and found this Ryzen 5 5th Gen with 8GB of Ram and a 256GB SSD.

It's been a normal learning curve, no different than any other laptop. I was pleasantly surprised to find it had a backlit keyborard.

It boots fast, programs load fast, it has done everything I've asked of it. I haven't done any gaming on it, so I can't comment on that performance. Runs Ubuntu with no issues.

,"This is an average laptop without any unique features, although some of the included Lenovo software tools are mildly helpful. So far much better than HP and Dell laptops, but durability remains to be seen. My experience with Dell is very bad, so this is a dream computer compared to Dell laptops I have had. One minor issue is don't believe what ""experts"" say about compatibility of this laptop with added memory/RAM. I tried to upgrade the memory with what expert boards said was compatible RAM (the specs were correct but even so some motherboards are not compatible with some RAM despite the overall specs being correct).

If you add one more 8gb stick, which costs like $50 or so, you will increase the performance a LOT because this AMD processor relies on having both RAM slots occupied to run best. I’m only using the one 8gb stick and it’s running this well, so if you spend the extra $50 you’ll have a really good laptop for casual gaming at the same price as a PS4 right now.

It seems to go faster than my last computer and it is easier to take places.

,"I bought this laptop for my college classes. I bought this laptop cause it was cheap and I only need a laptop for basic requirements like online classes and assignments. So, low specs would not have been a problem for me. I am not a computer science or engineering student so I don’t need programming/coding. All I needed was fast internet browsing and battery life. This laptop failed both the purposes. Not even two weeks and this laptop started getting slow. The battery would last only 1-2 hours when the specs says the battery life is around 7-8 hours. I could barely use it for one class. I couldn’t use it for my 5 hour upper division lab class either. The laptop also would stop responding in middle of working. There was also a weird sound when the laptop would start and it would also come when I would play any video. The screen also had started flickering. I would start a video and the screen would start flickering then black out and stop responding. I would have to shut it down using power button and restart the laptop. This issue started occurring very often. So, I had to return it. I already got the refund so that was nice."," May 7, 2022",1.0

Amazing laptop for the price,"Great size for portability and good performance. Mostly used for my daughter's college classes and Internet surfing.

7 months after buying, it was being used for basic school work and had been on and running for 3 or 4 hours and it just shut off while plugged in. It will now still charge the battery and will power on with and without wall power but the display will never show anything.

I've tried resetting the display using suggested key combinations from Internet articles of others having the same exact problem and even draining the battery and hard powering it off.

Attaching an external monitor does not work either. When the system is powered on now it just gets really hot because the fan doesn't come on even though it does spin fine at first power up.

I contacted support and without doing any troubleshooting they suggested that it was a hardware issue which suggests that this must be happening a lot to this model. The suggestion was to either ship it to them on your dollar or purchase a warranty program from them which would include onsite service.

It looks like you are also able to search for certified repair shops near you if you just want to take it somewhere for the warranty work. I have not decided so I can't speak to how either process works at this point. I can say that they did answer promptly when I called Lenovo."," July 4, 2022",1.0

I didn't want to return it to Amazon for credit because I would have lost out on the Prime Day discount.
Upon return from Lenovo the problem was not resolved. I got in touch with a tech support chat and they remoted in to attempt diagnosis and driver updates without success. The next day I got an email asking me to rate their service. I requested a phone call to discuss the problem. All I got were more emails with a case number and asking me to call in for support.

I have always loved Lenovo for the upgradability and build quality — I have owned the T40 and T440s in the past and absolutely admired those products.

In the past month I have tried the idea pad, the yoga line and the flex series but they were all utter trash.

The customer service reps at Lenovo are very kind but the Lenovo website itself is overly complicated. I cannot get a hold of anyone except by calling and waiting for 30 minutes.

,"The Lenovo I've been playing around with is the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 14"" Convertible Laptop, FHD (1920 x 1080) Touch Display, Intel Core i5-1035G1 Processor, 8GB DDR4 OnBoard RAM, 128GB SSD, Intel UHD Graphics, Win 10, 81X1004RUS, Graphite Grey version. So far in the month I've had it, it's been great. I am not a fan of Windows 10 Home, but it does the job for most things.

Pros:
- long battery life (outlasts my dell XPS)
- fingerprint reader/login
- side power button
- charges by USB-C
- has a card reader
- wifi 6, so killer internet connection
- keyboard is responsive and is comfortable to type on for long periods of time
- i5/8gb RAM/128gb SSD for a $699 price point makes this a good value

Cons:
- has a bit of bloatware
- every fingerprint shows up on the screen and the case
- not easy to modify or expand memory or hard drive (requires a special set of tools)

I was really hoping to crack this open and put a larger SSD in, but was disappointed when I realized I didn't have the required tools - this makes this not an ideal system for businesses or other enterprise uses that require the quick swap and replace of old/broken parts. I was also hoping for more than 1 USB-C port, as I wanted to connect this to a dock, but my dock doesn't have a power delivery feature, so there's no way to power the computer while connected to the dock I have. There are a few USB-A ports, but since I use a head set and mouse and often a couple flash drives, I don't have nearly as many as I would like. I also am not a fan of how greasy the computer looks now after almost a month of handling it. It seems like every time I've touched it or handled it, it's taken whatever oils I've had on my hands. I've attempted to try and lightly clean it, but it still looks gross.

For an i5 processor with 8gb of RAM with a 128gb SSD, this is actually a really great deal. There are only 2 other equivalent systems on the market, which are the HP ProBook and Acer Swift. The SSD is actually what makes up a good chunk of the Lenovo's price, but is also what allows for this laptop to start up so quickly and for a lot of programs to run seamlessly. With care, this laptop can last a good 2-3 years. It's just a shame it's such a magnet for dirt and grease."," August 31, 2020",5.0
Dead Computer!!!!!,"Perfect for remote learning. With our schools deciding not to open I decided to get this laptop for my 10 year old son. It offers so much more than I expected for the price and has been a good fit. My son was using his iPad to complete his work before, but It has its limitations and was harder to navigate. I also think he needs to get more used to using an actual keyboard, especially since there is no keyboard elective anymore. This was a great transition laptop because it has a touch screen as well. It is almost like a cross between an iPad and a computer which had been working out well. I like that the screen can fold backwards and looks more like a tv screen for his online meetings and video instruction. I think the picture and sound are both very clear and crisp. There is no very little lag when doing online meets. I like that it has a cover for the web camera too. I have a 10 year old who can be naive and still thinks all people are good. I keep a close eye but he does work independently when I’m working with my younger daughter. It is not fool proof I know, but it does give me a little more peace of mind.

The laptop looks small at first but I quickly realized it was the perfect size for my son. He can carry it around and it is very light. It folds flat on itself more like a tablet that allows him to use a stylus and write. It is very responsive as a laptop and in tablet mode. I have not had any problems loading and running large programs. It Is very speedy and efficient. I have allowed my son to load a few video games and he says it’s a good gaming laptop. I think the graphics are very impressive, but have little experience in gaming.

Overall I am very thankful to have this small but mighty laptop. It has made accessing and completing my sons school work much more efficient and that is always a good thing. Set up was easy and painless a
taking less than 15 minutes. I think the best part is the battery life is extra long with a short charging time. My son’s last laptop broke because the charging port broke. He had to leave in plugged in so much to play it that the constant tension on the ac plug broke the port. Thankfully that will be one issue we can avoid with this one due to the extended battery life. It’s a great laptop and I recommend it highly!"," August 18, 2020",5.0
,"GOOD:
+ Beautiful touch IPS screen
+ Great performance
+ 2-in-1 converts into tablet mode
+ Feels very similar to my work laptop Thinkpad T490s
+ Excellent keyboard
+ Pleasant sound from speakers
+ Charges through USB C PD
+ Responsive touchpad
+ Battery lasts a long time

BAD:
- Not enough USB-A ports, only 2
- No Ethernet port
- Not enough SSD space, only 128GB on this modern laptop?! Not user-upgradeable without voiding warranty
- RAM not upgradable
- No dedicated graphics card

THOUGHTS:
This Lenovo laptop has a lot of great features and is quite a perfect match for our family, especially for my wife. She needed a replacement for her old T420 Thinkpad that had a horrible screen and slow performance. This IdeaPad is actually very similar to my own Thinkpad T490s in both look and feel, except my T490s is not a convertible. In fact, this IdeaPad feel superior to my T490s! The laptop is slim and very portable.

She loves the flexibilty of the 2-in-1, because she teaches some classes online and it makes it so much easier to draw and annotate directly on the screen. She doesn't play games so 3D graphic speed is not an issue. We tired playing 4k videos from YouTube and this handled them like a champ. The sound from the speakers sounded great, making it suitable even for watching Netflix.

It's a bummer that this version only has 128GB of SSD space. You would think that they would put in at least 256GB. I asked Lenovo if I can upgrade the SSD but they replied back and said I would void the warranty if I tried to do it myself! That is ridiculous if you ask me. I checked some videos online and apparently, it is not that difficult to do it youself but do it at your own risk.

Overall, this is a very well designed everyday laptop that does not disappoint (except for the SSD)."," September 8, 2020",5.0
No Instructions,"Like has become so common everywhere, since COVID started I’ve had to completely change work and school routines and have found a need for some additional computers. What appealed to me about this Lenovo Ideapad Flex model is that it’s pretty compact as far as laptops go, has a touch screen, has a hinge so it can be used as a tablet, and has the option to add a digital pen. When reviewing the specs ahead of time, it looked like it would be sufficient for office work and school.

One of the things that first became apparent when getting this thing out of the box is that the hinge is very sturdy. I also had a positive first impression of the build quality, it's a nice looking/feeling device, aside from perhaps attracting fingerprints.

Getting this thing setup is pretty straight forward. You just power it on and go through a couple questions from Microsoft and are up and running pretty quickly.

This is my first convertible laptop and so I wasn’t sure how this would work, but was pleased to discover that the keyboard is disabled when you flip it back into tablet mode.

After cleaning up some of the preinstalled stuff that I didn’t want, the available storage space was about 85GB. There was also about 6GB of windows update files that could also be removed to get about 90GB of usable space.

Pros:
- Very sturdy hinge
- Nice form factor
- Screen is bright, no dead pixels, and has good resolution (1920x1080)
- Backlit keyboard makes it easier to use in the dark
- Capable processor is fast for office work/school
- Internal speakers sound good
- Expandable and can use a digital pen (I don’t have this to review)

Cons:
- 128GB of storage space (about 90GB of it usable, the rest is Windows) is OK for users that rely on cloud storage, may become a bottleneck for other users quickly. Storage can be expanded with the memory card slot or an external hard drive though.
- 8GB of RAM may become a bottleneck for heavy multitaskers
- Screen is glossy and attracts fingerprints

My perspective is this: This is quality hardware, a nicely designed device. The specs of this thing are best suited to people doing office work or school, that don’t do lots of heavy multitasking, and are OK relying on cloud storage. I think given that these specs are available up front, this laptop does what it set out to do perfectly so I am giving 5 stars. Just don’t expect to store tons of stuff on it or play resource heavy games and you’ll be good!"," September 4, 2020",5.0
,"Currently, there are a lot of students and people working from home. There is a need for quality laptops that are affordable. No frills laptop that gets the job done while offering performance that is more than adequate is what dominates this price point. The Lenovo Flex goes above this by providing a touch screen and the ability to switch into a tablet. At this price point, this allows for unparalleled productivity that just might be unrivaled.

The touch screen is a pleasure to use. Offering adequate color reproduction and at 14"", the 1080p screen provides enough resolution to enjoy watching videos. Speaking about the color profile on the screen, I found it to be too warm however, after some tinkering I was able to get the colors to be bright and vibrant.

This laptop offers a fantastic keyboard. Tactile and easy to pick up and go. Not much deck flex and the keys are not mushy. Which is great, because this should be targeting professionals and students, and it is perfect for typing.

The CPU is performant enough to get through word processing and opening up a plethora of tabs in a web browser. I was even able to edit some videos using the laptop. However the 8GB of RAM leaves something to be desired and the measly 128GB SSD is a sham. The first thing I would do is UPGRADE the SSD.

The laptop charges through USB C which is awesome. Included with the laptop, since it focuses on professionals, is a fingerprint scanner that I found fast and quite accurate.

Lenovo Flex is a great laptop for the professional and student. While it will not game, as it doesn't have a GPU, and has a mere 8GB of RAM, I was quite pleased with how the Flex performed. For what it is targeting, I believe this is a great laptop for students and can definitely RECOMMEND it."," November 18, 2020",5.0
The perfect School laptop,"The Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 14"" Convertible Laptop is an attractive, low profile, no-nonsense machine. It feels sturdy to hold and use, and hits most of my ""must have"" checkboxes. It took me a minute to figure out how to turn it on (the power button is on the side which I'm not used to.)
- The backlit keyboard is amazing. Once you've had it, going without is difficult. It makes it great to use in low light conditions. I like to turn down the screen brightness at night, when I have the lights low, and every letter and number being lit up is really helpful as I type.

- Multiple USB ports- such a critical feature. After using a laptop that only had one usb port, and having to unplug my wireless mouse any time I wanted to use any other device or plug in my phone to transfer files- ugh. I will never go back to a computer like my old one. I love that this has two USBs which allows me to keep my bluetooth mouse plug connected, and still have a port free to use for other things.
- The speakers are located on the top of the keyboard, which is a feature I'm not used to seeing on a laptop, but makes SO MUCH SENSE. If you're planning on doing any streaming or anything that requires sound, this is a great machine for that. You get much better sound volume and quality, as opposed to the many laptops out there that have the speakers on the underside, pointing in towards the desk!

Ultimately, I would prefer to have more memory/storage space. I'm someone who does like to do some video editing and keep several large files saved to my PC, which can take up a lot of room without adding much value. However, that's just a convenience thing. I do have an external HD that I'm in the habit now of using to store those files separately, to keep the space on my laptop free for other uses.
Overall, this is a great day to day computer, and would be excellent for school, recreation, or basic work (nothing super heavy duty.) I'm really happy with the way this computer performs."," August 23, 2020",5.0
,"It’s a Windows machine meaning that MS Office apps work extremely well with it- much better than trying to use it on an iPad.

This was never intended nor will it ever be a gaming computer, as you can’t upgrade the hardware. But it will definitely be suitable for working from home/homeschooling purposes, and there’s a chance if you’re reading this, that’s what you’re in the market for.

It’s an inexpensive alternative to a tablet/basic laptop. If you like MS Office, it’s better than an iPad. And yes, this has a smaller hard drive but since most photos and documents are cloud-based these days I don’t mind trading the weight of a hard drive for this being a little lighter.

Battery life does pretty well, lasts a few days with moderate use- watching movies, working on projects, etc. The screen is beautiful and shows everything well. The backlit keyboard is awesome but has to be turned on when you need it. I know this is a battery-saving feature so I understand why it doesn’t come on by itself. Keys are responsive and sturdy. Touchpad is really easy to use with gestures, scrolling, etc. I love the fingerprint scanner and it’s one of the better ones I’ve used. It’s lightweight and I didn’t mind carrying it around in a backpack.

You do have to buy a stylus separately, but this tablet combined with a Lenovo stylus, it makes it even more versatile.

I had no issues with the wifi card, have streamed HD movies for weeks and no complaints.

This charges through USB-C, which is convenient to me since that’s becoming mainstream. I hate having so many cords and adaptors and this is a big plus for me.

And last but not least, the cute little integrated shutter/cover for the webcam is brilliant and I love it.

It’s a great little machine and I’m very happy with it."," September 5, 2020",5.0
Great little machine. Love the backlit keyboard.,"OVERALL: At 14"" this laptop is the perfect size to toss in a bag on your way out the door. It's light, has a great keyboard, excellent battery life, and it can double as a tablet.

The specs are on the low end size, but that doesn't affect performance for every day life. With 8 gigs of ran, and a small 128 gig hard drive, this is the kind of laptop you use for basic stuff like web surfing, watching Netflix, and office or google apps.

The screen is the first ding against this laptop. It's not bright, and the colors are washed out. It is a touch screen which is surprising on this reasonably priced laptop. One miss is that the laptop doesn't come with any kind of stylus, or pen for drawing/writing on the screen.

The keys are back-lit and they are pleasant to type on. It has a small touchpad, and rounding out the cool features, there is a finger print reader for logging into the machine.

Battery life is solid and you can expect to get between 4 and 6 hours depending on what you're running. The integrated graphics card is good, and can run some light games, just don't expect to play Doom Eternal on this rig.

For the price, this is a fantastic value."," September 14, 2020",5.0
,"UPDATE** We're months into using this laptop and have had zero issues and system is still running flawless!

I am VERY please with this laptop. The option of using it as a laptop AND a tablet have just blew me away. The 14 inch screen is perfect for me and I find it very clear and sharp. The computer is flawless and the design is sleek and lightweight. Battery life last around 6 hours when using it consistently for computer games. I love the webcam has a switch to close it for privacy- that's' important. The webcam view is clear and I have no lag when I'm on a zoom meeting. Easily stays connected to my WIFI and set up was easy. The system walks you through set up. The keyboard is quiet and the mouse-pad is precise. I LOVE the fingerprint login. It's a huge plus for me. The fingerprint scanner works just like my Iphone when unlocking. You have a 360-degree hinge so it's easily turned into a tablet like set up.

Great iPad alternative- lightweight & good battery life!,"If you are using this to play simple games it will work but if definitely won't run bigger games. That said this is great for work.
I am working from home and my old laptop just couldn't keep going. This connects easily (tho you do need a Microsoft account to even get the thing going) and has everything you need. Touch screen is pretty on point and if folds nicely. It is heavier than a lot of other models that fold. But as long as you don't plan to stand all day holding it you should be fine.
Smooth mouse pad, camera slides locked and unlocked easy and speakers work well. You can definitely watch Netflix on this."," August 17, 2020",5.0
,"I liked this laptop. It is fast, and it games well. The only issue is its WIFI card. I am getting 100+mbps of download speed on my iMac, whereas I am getting barely 20mbps on the Lenovo laptop.

The laptop was very easy to set up. The touch screen is responsible and easy to use if you are like me and like to use a stylus to take notes during class. I like the small attention to detail, too. Items like the webcam shutter and fingerprint scanner just make the quality of life much nicer than laptops of the past."," August 15, 2020",5.0

,"Although this is a very good all around laptop, I was immediately disappointed in the screen brightness, which is only about 75% of what it should be. Most every other laptop I have used has a bright, brilliant screen.. not this. I'll add that I have a similarly disappointing Lenovo Carbon X1 2017, with the exact same disappointingly dim screen. The only other knock I have for this IdeaPad is that there is too much weight in the screen, so it's easier to tip backwards if my hands aren't on the keyboard. In summary: very good laptop, disappointingly dim screen."," September 15, 2020",5.0
Lenovo really needs to stop using DIM screens!,"It worked fine for about two months before the auto rotate feature stopped working and would lock my screen sideways, and another couple of weeks before the fingerprint scanner stopped working consistently. And now, only three months after spending $800 on my laptop, it doesn't go to sleep and will drain the whole battery in 2 hours after being unplugged, whether I'm using it or not. Customer service has left me HIGHLY UNSATISFIED and I can't use my laptop for anything I need it for. Find you a better laptop that will actually last."," February 13, 2021",5.0
,"My Lenovo started to get blue screens each time that I start it, at least twice. It has not been dropped. It has not been misused.

Its keyboard stops working at times when it does that. I have to restart it, after about three to four restarts, it resumes working. This happens every day that I use it and I have a desktop, so I have only used it once to two times a week since I bought it!

It is very frustrating. Their quality really is not good. My Dell is still going strong, and that was the computer that I used before I bought the Lenovo to replace it. It should not just go bad on its own like this."," January 15, 2021",5.0
Constant Problems,"Well here we are Oct 2021 -
This machine did not last.
I really don't think anyone was all that hard on it by any means.
Half the keys no longer work.
Some of them totally broke off.
One of the usb ports stopped working as well .
Daughters used it for a few months for her schoolwork but then we upgraded her computer and I took this one for my LIGHT use.
I don't really do much online other than work on some photo editing and a bit of chat with friends.
Nearly gave up on this one but spent too much on it to totally say goodbye to it.
Now it is used more as a stationary PC unit.
I have it up on a riser with a keyboard below the shelf.
Also had to get a shelf/riser that had USB built in since down to only one workable port on the laptop.
Would I ever get this model again... ummm NOPE not a chance.

We got this machine for our daughter who is a senior in high school. She is doing distance learning due to covid and she uses this machine as her daily means of doing her zoom meets as well all of her assignments. She really appreciates the touchscreen and the convertible display so she can use this like a tablet. It's got plenty of horsepower for her use. She also does quite a bit of word processing as she is a budding author. Very nice solid lightweight design. It really has a good, quality look and it feel when you handle it. I'd recommend this if you're in the market for a nice laptop."," October 18, 2020",5.0
," TL:DR - DO NOT BUY! Bad service that would not allow me to purchase an upgraded warranty (even though I should have been), which then screwed me when issues started to occur--both USB ports stopped working and I have multiple display issues.

Since working from home has become the norm over the last year, I decided to “upgrade” my ten years old laptop because I assumed it would work better and have fewer issues. Not only have I had more issues with this laptop, but the customer service is also atrocious. I want nothing more than to receive a refund and purchase another brand, but that is not in the cards for me.
I had attempted for four to five weeks to improve my warranty with the laptop. I did not want to have to send my computer in for weeks to repair it. The cost was affordable for on-site repair, so I tried to purchase. I tried to use the online portal about thirty times over the course of a month. I attempted to use their chat feature. I attempted to call. Every time I tried They told me something was wrong with my card. While on hold with Lenovo I called my bank and told them to allow the charge with Lenovo. Here I was attempting to give this company my money and they would not take it. Then my USB ports both go out within a couple of weeks of each other. I call and they tell me I have to send my computer to Texas like I could be without a computer for several weeks. I inform them that I have been attempting to purchase a better warranty for weeks and would like to purchase that and get on-site care. Because I had already started a ticket item for my USB ports, even if I upgrade my warranty, I still have to send in my computer for this issue. Here I am trying to purchase this warranty for weeks and then an issue occurs and they want to further screw me out of being able to work for several weeks, or I could pay $80 for them to come onsite--which is more expensive than the entire two years of on-site help! This company will tempt you with great deals but screw you in the end with inferior products and services.
The laptop also has multiple visual issues. Sometimes my screen just goes black for no reason and I have to restart it. Sometimes the screen randomly starts to flicker and makes it near impossible to read the text onscreen, which only is alleviated by restarting. Sometimes the screen glitches when I separate a tab on Firefox and pixelates for a second. Being a teacher I need to be on zoom with my class for between five to seven hours a day. This laptop has made it more difficult to run my classroom on a day-to-day basis. Even as I am typing this my screen has flickered multiple times.
Please do yourself a favor and purchase a laptop from someone else.

,"My old 2012 ThinkPad, that I used for a few things to keep those things off my newer computer, finally died. I selected this Ideapad as a reasonable option for those uses.

As most people know, ThinkPads have the best keyboard in the business. This machine can't meet that standard, but it is pretty good for a laptop. I'm a fast touch typists and I got along with it.

The screen looks good but is only 1366x768 which isn't very inspiring for a 15 inch screen. This machine is not meant for gaming or high class photo and video editing!

One very nice feature that many computer makers don't provide: The top row of keys has shifted options for various features of the computer. This machine, like most competitors comes set so the those extra options are not shifted. You have to press Fn+F key to get a function key to work. Not very good for people who know Windows short cut keys or who have software that regularly uses function keys. Fortunately this machine has an option in the BIOS to restore the keys to the proper function. I almost never use those extra key features but routinely use the actual function keys, so this makes the computer much more pleasant to use.

In comparison to the old ThinkPad which I had downgraded to 4gig of ram and an old 360 gig HD, this machine is blazing fast with 12 gig of ram and a 256 gig SSD. It is also very slim and light so it is much easier to carry. However I was surprised it didn't charge via USB and the power brick has fixed prongs, not folding prongs. That is a minor complaint but still surprising. I haven't used it long enough to test the battery life.

Big warning: This machine comes with Windows 10S which I thought I heard had been withdrawn by MS? If you don't want to be limited to using only apps from the Windows Store, be sure to Google how to switch from 10S back to Windows Home. I would have returned this machine if I couldn't switch back to real Windows 10.

Also, if you prefer using local accounts on the machine, rather than a Microsoft Account, be sure to ignore the option to link to WiFi during the setup. Only if it doesn't have a network connection will it allow you to set up a local account. You can always connect to WiFi after finishing the setup."," January 12, 2021",4.0

Set screen brightness at 75% and tilt slightly back a little further than normal to correct washed out appearance. Battery life is running at about 7 hrs. with intermittent use. I did shut down all unnecessary apps from running in the background in the settings. I'm not a fan of Windows 10 s-mode which limits the user to apps from the Microsoft Store. You can switch to win. 10 home for free which does not require this limitation, however I have a 250 gb ssd in my unit so I have not switched and I'm trying to work with the S-mode, I may switch sometime in the future. I do recommend this laptop for general use around the home, my only complaint is that the graphics could be better., Ok I used this laptop for about 2 more weeks and I would add that I have switched it out of the Windows 10 s-mode without any problems. There was no significant issue or change to the amount of used space on the 250 gb hard drive and it is operating normally in the Win 10 standard (home) mode which is a free switch so it will now accept apps from outside the windows store."," December 4, 2020",4.0

Poor battery life,"After spending a couple hours on initial setup, I attempted to install my primary software, and discovered that this machine came with Windows in S mode. Say what? I had specifically bought this particular model over some other choices because it did NOT say it was coming with Windows S mode. So I figured, ok, no big deal. Switching out of S mode is supposed to be fairly simple. I follow the instructions on Microsoft's site, and it directs me to the Windows Store to get the ""Switch out of S mode"" app. Weird, but okay...
So I try to ""get"" the app, and instead all I see is a vague error saying ""something happened and we couldn't start the upgrade"". Lovely.
I tried for the next few hours everything I could find online to fix it, but with no progress.
I called Lenovo, who basically told me to pound sand, unless I wanted to pay them for ""premium software support"". Oh no, I'm not paying you to get my brand new laptop working!
I finally got on the phone with Microsoft directly, and spoke with a nice lady who was able to remote into the machine (using Quick Assist), and verify the error.
After trying everything she knew (including setting up a new user account with a Microsoft account auto-login), she finally gave up and we performed a clean install of Windows 10 Home, using a custom config file she helped me inject into the iso file I downloaded from MS servers.
So now my machine is finally up and running regular Windows 10 Home, version 20H2, without all the Lenovo bloatware.
All-in-all, this was a truly painful process, and a complete waste of time. This machine never should have come with the pointless S mode enabled to begin with.

,"I know these reviews don't always end up on the right product, so be careful. Mine came in a ""Microsoft certified"" box.

Despite it saying otherwise, mine came with the good version of the screen, as well as the backlit keyboard. Upgraded it to 32GB of RAM, and have been running SQL Server, VS Code, Visual Studio, and SSIS on it to learn the Microsoft ecosystem. If you aren't familiar with the Thinkpad line, check out the Thinkpad subreddit and they can tell you all about it... these things have quite a following, and I believe are what NASA uses on the ISS.

Also, had no idea what Windows Hello was, but that was a very, very nice surprise!

note that this model has 2 batteries- an internal one like usual, and an external battery that is hotswappable. Two entire laptop batteries already gives you MacBook Pro-tier battery life (probably better), but if you just have to have more, you can buy extra batteries to hotswap on to keep it up indefinitely."," July 6, 2023",4.0
"Good refurbisher, ended up better than expected","Bought this in a pinch for a new job, arrived like a brand new unused laptop - aside from some skin oils on the surface, but it shows these smudges easier than anything.

Setting up worked out terrific, required some extra help from someone a little more software familiarity than I have in order to ensure there were no traces (which I recommend for these rebuilds regardless), but overall once things were rolling and I was signed in, everything has flowed very smoothly. Stable, responsive, good computing power, good battery life.

Other than the surfaces being so prone to collecting oils, my only other minor issues would be with the fact the screen likes to go out for a second or two maybe once or twice a day."," June 15, 2023",4.0

Best $200 laptop around,"I bought one of these for my son for Christmas. It was awesome! Everything was perfect. It even came with the extended battery (61+) as opposed to the regular one (61). 7 hours of battery life (or so it says, didn't try it). We'll his mom was due for an upgrade to windows 10. The computer is so good and the price so reasonable I ordered another one for her.

When I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was that the keyboard wasn't properly installed. It was loose at the bottom. I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending the computer back and getting another one. I'm impatient that way. I do my own repairs, and seating the keyboard is an easy fix. So far so good.

Then I set up the computer and started installing software and then I got a message that one of the batteries was defective and needed to be replaced. Without thinking, I ordered the external battery, but then by the time I received it, I noticed that it was the internal battery that was bad, so I had to re-order the right battery and that took an extra day. My mistake. I sent the other one back. Meanwhile I disabled the internal battery in the BIOS then opened the laptop and disconnected it so as not to keep getting error messages. I got next day delivery (two days from when I started setting it up) on the internal battery. It took all of about 10 minutes to get it installed. The computer wouldn't turn on right away, but this is a know issue with ThinkPads, and easy to solve. Got that done and everything is working fine, the battery was definitely dead and replacing it solved the problem.

Fixing the two problems was easy, but I'm out $44 to replace the internal battery. The price was so low, that's not a big deal and worth the hassle, but as a matter of principle, it would be nice if they reimbursed me for the replacement battery. Maybe I'll contact them.

Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. The laptops are great. They look like new and work very well. They have all the features I wanted, and the RAM and SSD are easily upgradable should I decide to do so (that's the reason I bought the T480 instead of the T490)."," January 13, 2023",4.0

,"In the picture, my old ASUS laptop is on the left, bought new for $600 in 2019. The new 2020 Lenovo on the right, for $499. I needed to replace my ASUS due to a manufacturing defect, and decided I needed something a little larger.

Comparing the Lenovo to the ASUS-

- Lenovo is much faster even though it has around the same specs as the ASUS. Loading webpages, opening programs, etc. is almost instant on the Lenovo.

- My biggest issue with my ASUS is that it would easily overheat if my screen was too bright or I overwhelmed the CPU fan and it made this awful grinding noise, I have yet to experience any overheating issues with the Lenovo even with running webpages, videos, games, and over programs at once.

- The keyboard buttons do look cheaper since they aren't backlit like on the ASUS, but I find the keyboard overall to be much easier to see and use on the Lenovo, the number pad on the right is a great addition as I use my laptop for work as well as gaming.

- The screen on the ASUS does seem to be better quality picture as it's more of a touchscreen glass, and the Lenovo screen is more of a traditional laptop screen. However, both touchscreen work just was well, and I feel like I found see as many finger marks as I do on the glass screen.

- The sound quality and loudness is much better on the Lenovo, like, super loud.

- Even though these two laptops are vastly different sizes, they weigh about the same. I find the larger screen on the Lenovo also easier to see, as the ASUS is only 13"".

All in all, I am pleasantly surprised with how well the laptop works. Along with the expedient shipping and care put into packaging. Good warranty terms as well. Over one month in and everything is still working as good as the first day, let's hope it keeps working that way!"," April 7, 2021",4.0
It's nice,"This is a pretty good laptop. The touch screen works well, and so does the webcam. It works very well with Zoom and allows you to use digital backgrounds and advanced Zoom settings. I like it, but I do want to note a few negatives that I noticed, some of which led me to return and exchange my laptop.

1. It had a problem with the internet driver/adapter. This issue happened to me twice with about 10 days in between incidents. When it happened, the laptop disconnected from wireless internet on its own, and could not be connected again until I reset the internet settings.

2. The Settings are cumbersome. I found it difficult to find what I needed in Settings and the setup was not intuitive.

3. The screen is not very bright. I usually need to turn the brightness up to 100% before I am satisfied. This tends to drain the battery. If the brightness is up, it is totally fine, but it is a little bothersome that the default isn't brighter.

4. Remember to turn off S-mode in Settings if you want to download apps such as Zoom.

5. Battery life is okay but underwhelming. Also, note that the charger has a large block, about 3*4*2 inches."," February 7, 2022",4.0

,"This is an all-plastic laptop, but has a fairly rigid build, not like metal, but far less flex on the screen than my 5 year old Acer Aspire which needed many replacements due to flexing including a cracked screen, hinges, and back cover. This has 8 GB memory. This has and older GTX 1650. This has a 120hz display (unheard of at this price point) This has 256SSD m.2. It has a backlit Keyboard. It has an amazing processor: AMD Ryzen 5.

Here's the deal. You can get similarly priced laptops that have more storage and RAM, touchscreen, etc... but you will trade down the pieces that future-proof this machine. I can walk into Walmart and get a similarly priced Pentium, i3 or a similarly priced i5 with more RAM or storage or maybe a touchscreen (if that’s important to you), but no dedicated graphics, no backlit keyboard, or expansion slots for ram or SSD. However, I can always buy more RAM or hard drive later when the price will actually be lower. I can NOT come back later and upgrade the CPU, add slots to increase the RAM, and all of a sudden make my keyboard visible in the dark when I want to work late at night sometime. I can't later upgrade the screen to 120hz as this one has. And, the GPU at this price range is perfectly adequate (Although not as future-proof). The Battery has a LOT to be desired and could be a deal breaker. I can get 5 to 6 hours if optimized back (all but battery-saver mode). My old Acer had 12 hour battery, but the screen was a significant tradeoff.

Some people are saying only 6 GB RAM. That is because of the new way Ryzen processors use dedicated RAM instead of shared RAM. There is 8, it is just that old processors shared the RAM with the system. Now the new processors are dedicating part of the RAM to the processor permanently. It isn't too much different than before, but does change the way the RAM is handled and displays for availability for Windows.

My system is gaming fine right now with the existing setup, but I'm not a power user. I'll wait until I can't live with the performance and then I'll go buy more RAM and SSD when it comes down lower in price, because I can. Beware of machines that downgrade built in pieces to give you more memory and hard-drive, but will be outdated in 4-7 years instead of 7-10+ years depending on what you plan to do with the machine. Those are not good tradeoffs. Lenovo seems to have hit a sweet spot in this price range with its optimal upgradeability and good built in features for for the price you pay.

If you need a power machine, this is not it. This is a good midrange machine that will allow you to do a diverse amount of tasks without lagging out or crashing, and should last a long time with the specs it has."," January 11, 2022",4.0

Battery not charging out of the box.,"I did alot of research prior to my purchase and this deal hands down was the absolute best for my use case.

I needed a new laptop for work and with the next gen console nightmare I thought Id get one that can do a bit of intermediate level gaming as well.

Firstly the look of most laptops in this price range were a no go for me. The hp pavilion and acer nitro look too ""gamery"" as I carry this to work with me most days. This laptop unlike those looks standard and Lenovo is a brand I've had many positive experiences with before.

The speed is lightning quick and I've added an additional 8 gb of ram and a 1tb m.2 ssd which has improved performance even more and covered my one gripe which was the lack of storage. The upgrade itself was pretty easy to do myself.

As for the gamimg experience, with only a gtx 1650 you do have to tone down your settings in most titles to come close to capping out your 120hz screen but I'm fine with that. I've attached two pictures of apex legends in the firing range after running around, shooting and using abilities for 5 mins each doing my best to simulate what your in-game experience would be. One picture shows the results at all min settings and the other at all max settings. At all max the fps dips to between 30 to 40 with alot of stuff happening on the screen (bangalore smokes and simultaneous ultimates for example). This isnt really playable in a game where frames matter. At all min you sit at 110 to 130 most of the time with a dip to maybe 70-80 under the conditions I detailed above. The textures are pretty bad however. I've settled on a low-med mix that nets me around 80-90 most of the time. Compared to my ps4 (RIP my next gen ownership ambition btw) this feels amazing. If you want to experience games at their full graphical intensity and dont want to be forced to skimp on visuals look elsewhere but be prepared to pay at least 100% more for a 3060 laptop or at least 30-50% more on a 3050ti laptop.

If this is your budget then I DEFINITELY recommend this laptop."," October 15, 2021",4.0
,"i have had this for a bit now. i've upgraded to 16gb ram, and have 750gb storage across 2 ssd's. I am running nobara linux solo.

it's not hard to put a new stick of ram in[it's under the metal seating in the middle, i use ddr4 by vengeance]
it definitely has room for either a hdd or ssd, open slot on the left. [i use m.2 nvme ssd seagate]

this is at the moment my only computer, and it does it's job. whether it's on windows or linux, nvidia and amd graphics together is a headache and a half. the setup burns through battery no matter how hard you try to save it. but it does pretty great as a semi-permanently attached to the wall rig.

i use it for work, hobby programming, and occasional gaming. it can handle most steam games, and no emulator has ever struggled on it. great for watching books, and I can edit videos without much issue.

it's very awkward, and the price tag is just not right. it hasn't changed a dollar since i purchased it. but i definitely have been too harsh on it, it's not too bad.

----old review----

i got this for work and travel, with a bit of gaming to relax. I can't say I'm a satisfied customer, but it does work pretty good aside from that. I ended up putting linux on it to get some more performance out of it and open my options up more[running a lightweight distro and DE helps a lot for gaming here]

pros:
easy to open
comes with everything you need to install another HDD
cons:
effectively useless off the wall charger
doesn't feel like it's meant for gaming

Reasonable price,"It was in Windows 11 despite it saying windows 10 on the market but overall the gaming experience of the laptop itself is amazing. Very silent, very affordable."," March 21, 2023",4.0
,"For sure this is the more affordable, easily upgradeable gaming laptop in the market this year. Not only for the cost ($660) but for the improvements you can do. The keyboard is rock solid; the 120 Hz display is awesome, the heat dissipation is very good, despite that the laptop heats significantly when is working hard or gaming. But, in general, the build is much better than other brands in the same price range. In fact, right now is $100 or less than other laptops with the same hardware or worse. The first picture shows the interior of the laptop, exactly as it arrived.

I recommend to do two important improvements in the laptop. The first one is to improve the RAM. Firstly, because with a single module works at single channel. But my recommendation is to replace the original ram module in the laptop. AMD processors are very sensitive to memory latency and rank. But the memory that came by default is a single side/dual rank (1Rx16) Samsung memory. If you look up for reviews in expert channels in Youtube (like Linus Tech Tips or Jarrod's Tech), the speed with a single rank/double side RAM improves up to 20%. I opt for these pair of T-Force modules, because right now is the cheapest and works so fine, exactly like other more expensive memories.

The second important improvement I recommend is the hard drive. The laptop came with a WD 256gb PCIe 3.0 disc, relatively slow (1900-950 Mb/s), but tiny (2242). The motherboard supports up to PCIe 4.0, so you can buy a disc up to 7000 Mb/s. For the second 2280 slot I choose a 2TB Inland disc, considerably faster (3500-3000 Mb/s), but considerably cheaper than a PCIe 4.0 disc. The motherboard supports 2 NVMe discs and an additional SATA disc, and the laptop came with adapters and the enclosure for a standard 2.5 SATA disc (mechanical or SSD). But unfortunately, there is no way (o no clean way) to connect all the three discs at the same time. It can be done in a dirty way, if anyone figures it out.

,"Ive had this for about a year now, great for any game I want to play. Amazing 120hz screen, its 1080p and has pretty good color matching. Performance is great, the Ryzen 5 5600h is amazing for any game and any task. The GTX 1650 is a little outdated but is good at gaming any game at mid to high settings and still get above 60fps. Great at rending, great at video and photo editing, and the coolers keep the cpu and gpu from over heating, have not had any thermal throttling at all. The port selections are good, having a type c hub is good if you have external accessories like me. Both USB type A ports are nice and fast, and the type c can do anything a usb c can do. Best buy for how much i got it for, which was $650. Good laptop if you're into moblie gaming but don't care about playing 4k at 200fps. Great for kids, cheap on price, but not performance. Only thing I did was upgrade the ram and storage and its been running perfect since.

1.5 year evaluation,"I do not know computer building to well, what I do know is genuine surprise when people see the specs and hear the price I paid. From what I have been told this is a steal through and through.

Pros:
Price, I cannot reiterate this enough, I had to quickly buy a laptop to use for school and personal use and this came incredibly clutch. The cost for what your getting is very much worth it.
Performance, runs great, can't get into the specifics but have not had any issues since purchasing arpund 10/2021
Portability, fits in my backpack on way to class and keyboard also has numpad which my last laptop didn't so that's great to have in an already compact laptop

Cons,
Battery, Playing video games battery dies less than an hour, not playing games and just working on stuff, can probably get to 4 max if you turn down the specs but that may be a specific issue for me
Harddrive, not a lot of space overall, in fact my old dell laptop that I used before this had more space, but to also be candid one can very easily use a separate external drive if space is that important

Overall, the only reason I did not give five stars is because five stars implies perfection and this is not quite there, I love the laptop and it's amazing in many regards but battery life and storage are valid reasons to not be perfect. Regardless, great laptop."," March 25, 2022",4.0
,"I really like the laptop itself. They did advertise that it was windows 10, even though it's windows 11, which makes me pretty mad because I hate windows 11 and all of my other devices are windows 10. Not a super big deal but slightly annoying. I use it for school and for games occasionally. One thing about playing games is that it throttles your fps unless you're plugged in, which was annoying initially, but not a big deal. This makes more sense now that I realize how bad the battery is. I'm lucky if I get 1 minute per 1% of battery life, even just doing school on battery saving mode. It's unfortunate but it just means you'll have to be charging constantly. Don't expect to be able to take this to a coffee shop and study without having to make sure you're sitting next to an outlet.

"Great laptop, horrible battery.","When I first had my Nitro 5, there was a lot I loved about. It could reach 120fps and was decent for most of my games. I loved it. But when I had to upgrade, I genuinely didn't want to spend too much as a working student. I did a lot of research and yes, the top brands of ACER , ASUS, HP, ALIEN they had great laptops obviously. But finding this one was a god sent. I can clock out at 240fps on most of my games. The upgrades to 16gb RAM and to add my HYBRID drive was flawlessly easy. The design is very sleek, mint fresh and effortlessly classy and simple. In fact, it stays well hidden as a gaming laptop. It's lightweight and easily portable for travel as a student compared to the 7lbs most gaming pcs start with.

The cons I had with this were it was a bit smaller than the average 15.6 laptop. A bit. Measured, it's a direct 15.6 but still pales by a slight inch to normal laptops. The other issue is that the fans are beneath and there is no air flow towards the back of the laptop. So, I would advise investing in a cooling pad for playing demanding games in order to protect your laptop. Furthermore, it only has two USB ports. Not a massive deal as I can easily buy an external USB device to add more ports but it was a let down. Apart from that, those are all the cons I would say, which pale in comparison to the pros.

In conclusion, this is a beast of a laptop. To find an affordable laptop which upgrades easily and has amazing fps and runs smoothly while providing easy portability is rare. The cons are things which can be easily overlooked due to the vast amount of pros this offers. If you're looking for a budget gaming laptop as a student, this is definitely your buy."," September 11, 2021",4.0

Best Budget Gaming Laptop,"I spent weeks trying to find the best budget laptop and landed on this one. For a while I stuck with Acer Nitro 5 as the main contender, but then I came across this one- the Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3. Watched a lot of review videos on it and it had an overall better rating than the aforementioned acer laptop.

Now it would be a solid 5/5 for me if it weren’t for one teeny tiny crucial thing: it had Windows 11 instead of Windows 10 like it says on the product description on Amazon. I’ve done my research on the new operating system, and from what I’ve gathered, it’s a downgrade for most. Personally, I have yet to encounter any problems, but I literally just got it today so that update next month oughta clear things up. Still disappointed to not have Windows 10, though.

Update: Still exceeds expectations, windows 11 isn’t as bad as some people make it seem. It really comes down to preference regarding the operating system, but overall, I’m satisfied with my purchase."," May 28, 2022",4.0
,"I spent a LONG time considering different laptops, WEARY of the fact that most machines are built to fail, because premature failure drives the market due to endless greed. I decided on this one due to low rate of failure and no apparent major modes of failure. After a few months, so far no issues. Will update this review if that changes.

Long story short, this machine is FAST and CAPABLE, and most importantly UPGRADEABLE—the latter of which is what makes this model stand out, and why I chose it. Here are the upgrades I installed:

-It comes with a quality M.2 NVMe SSD, which is VERY fast and serves best as a system drive where you install all of your programs and applications for maximum performance. There is also a 2.5"" SATA SSD compartment, where you should install a quality 2.5"" SSD from Samsung or Kingston, and use it for data storage. NOTE: All the hardware necessary for that comes with the laptop, which is very professional and deserves a word of recognition.

-It comes with a quality Samsung 8GB or 3200MHz DDR4 RAM, which by itself is not on par with the rest of the specs, especially your two fast SSDs. Add another 8 or 16GB for best performance, but make sure you get 3200MHz to match the original stick. Crucial or Samsung is recommended, I installed Crucial in mine and works like magic.

-I also bought an external optical drive by LG."," May 14, 2022",4.0

,"For some reason, windows won't recognize the touchpad, but I plug in a regular mouse and it's fine. It could be a windows 10 home edition issue, but I'm not sure. Other than that, it really blew my expectations out the water.

Productivity:
I use Davinci resolve 17, adobe Photoshop, illustrator, and after effects. Despite it only have 8 gigs of ram to work with (will upgrade to 16), the 6 core Ryzen chip smashes it out the water, no freezing, and gets it done pretty well.

Gaming:
Gtx 1650 isn't the best, but it's more than enough for what I play.
Been playing fallout 4 with max settings and hardly drops below 60fps.
Although the monitor is a 120hz panel, you won't be seeing that with AAA titles, but if you play eSports, it really won't be an issue.

Battery life:
Although, I play on the charger 100% of the time, but when I do use it on battery, it holds a 2-4 hour charge doing video editing and media consumption.

All in all, a $700 laptop with these specs, it's pretty good. The rgb keyboard in the ad is misleading, it only has a white backlit keyboard, and that mouse issue, it's a good bang for the buck productivity, and budget gaming laptop.

Recommendations:
Buy a 1tb SSD upgrade, 256 gigs simply isn't enough in 2021, bump up the ram to 16 gigs too, it'll help out that Ryzen chip be even better."," September 24, 2021",4.0
"Very nice, will update on it after a month","Great value for the money, but take note when upgrading the parts internally:

One, it can take an additional 2.5 inch laptop sized HDD/SSD but you need to install the HDD SATA ribbon cable in the board yourself. It comes in a bag inside the box so don't throw the box away when you get it. If you lose it, it seems on eBay they're like 15-20 bucks.

Secondly, be VERY CAREFUL when installing more RAM and putting the metal RAM shield back on. It comes with a Samsung stick of 8GB 3200MHz, and another slot is left open for another DIMM. I installed another stick, and attempted to put the metal RAM shielding back on the board, and when I pushed it down one time I had sparks fly up at me from the board. Luckily it still worked when I turned it back on, but I don't know if I just fried something that will shorten the machine's life span in the long run (which is the reason I gave this four stars, because that's very poor design choice on Lenovo's part to have a metal shield around some kind of exposed capacitor that can make sparks and potentially fry the board)."," December 29, 2021",4.0

Everything was working well when I received it except for a little back light bleed on the bottom right corner (but you wouldn't notice it most times). Wish the screen was brighter as well but i kinda knew what i was getting. Would definitely recommend to upgrade to 16gb ram and add an extra ssd for more storage as I did especially if you are gaming. Most games work fine in high settings and the fans run well to keep the device from overheating. Another issue came up after 2 weeks of using.

,"Ive had this laptop for 2 weeks now and if I consider the one I had before , this is a massive upgrade, as a software developer who does gaming as a hobby and a bit of content creation , I wanted a machine that could handle coding workload and android emulation (for mobile apps) and could also handle big gaming titles ,not just esports titles at a respectable framerates (atleast 60fps) . I'm telling you this laptop is a beast, powers through anything I did throw at it. Haven't tested the emulation part but it should handle that pretty well.
I was having a hard time to pick between this and the HP Pavilion gaming laptop which has the same specifications, but what really made me pick this was the *upgradability* which allows one to add another nvme M.2 drive albeit you have to buy a standoff for it or a 2.5 inch Ssd/hard drive and 2 soddim slots (i highly recommend adding the RAM and storage).

Great for basic gaming,"At the moment I have not had to use it very strongly. But for what I've been using it for, it's worked great.
The charger is a bit over the top (big), but not a big deal.
UPDATE (8/18/22): I have had the computer for about 8 months and a few months ago it started having different failures.
USB and C ports work when they want.
The wifi is constantly messing up and I have to use the troubleshooter to fix whatever needs to be fixed and let me connect again.
Recently, something similar happened with the printer. I had to remove it and reinstall it for the computer to recognize it.
On a couple of occasions the touchpad got stuck and wouldn't allow the pointer to move normally across the screen.

I decided to contact amazon customer service and the first people that came to me were not very helpful. Since I wasn't home, I decided to wait until I got back to have the original box and stuff available for the return process.

,"2-Week Review: This laptop is everything I hoped it would be for the price. I'm using it for gaming, 1080p video editing, and watching movies. It's wicked fast compared to the 6 year old Dell business laptop I was using before. I added a 1TB nvme drive and an extra stick of 3300MHZ ram for a total of 16GB.

Misleading product,"I bought this in October of 2021. In the just over a year from purchase, I have had issues that crop up every 3 or 4 months. My first contact with Lenovo fixed it enough that I did not get to the point where the damn thing insisted on windows being reinstalled but the problem came back. Just went through a another go with Lenovo support to try to fix it. We'll see if it actually fixes it or if it's just another band-aid in a few months I guess. I feel like I have no choice but to pay for the extended warranty just so I can have this problem repeatedly 'fixed'. Doubt I will be supporting Lenovo with any further purchases of laptops. One of the worst parts is that I don't feel like I could pass this one to my child when I replace it like I had intended.

Quick and well made laptop.,"I got this laptop as an IT student to do coding, studying, and some IT projects. Also the touch screen was a draw to me for reading and things like that. This laptop has definitely exceeded my expectations. My old laptop was an acre aspire with an dedicated Nvidia GPU, but this laptop blows that one out of the water.

I’m not a gamer but I played GTA V and Skyrim on high settings with no lag what so ever. My old laptop could barley handle medium low graphics. So to me that tells me if this laptop can handle a complex game like GTA V on near full settings, it can definitely handle other graphics intensive applications no problem.

I also have Ubuntu installed alongside Windows and it boots insanely fast (like 5 seconds after pressing power).

This is my first AMD chip laptop and touch screen one and it’s been great so far.

The screen is also beautiful and big enough for my needs. I’m glad I took a chance on it.

However, there was a ton of bloat ware/ free apps I had to un install and also a lot of startup apps Windows 11 likes to include. After removing those it’s boots and performs faster. Also, there are a ton of things you can do with the Lenovo Vantage app. Such as conservation mode on the battery (which is recommended if you keep it plugged in a lot)."," February 26, 2023",5.0
,"So the computer itself looks nice. And it has a pencil that comes with it which is also nice. It has a fingerprint reader, which is also nice. But I don’t know where the power went to. I charge it to 100% and then shut it down and then the next day when I turned it on it was at 50%. It said I had 1 hour and 27 minutes left to the battery life. And I didn’t do anything overnight with, so I’m questioning where the power went to? So as I said, it has a fingerprint reader, but every time I turn it on spin, asking me to enter a pin number or password. If I have a fingerprint reader, that should be one of the options initially. I did set it up with my fingerprint before going through all that other things about the password. It’s a good enough computer. It just has some quirks. And all the time is asking me to put in a McAfee subscription or to buy one. I can’t tell you how many fake emails I get every day about some McAfee subscription or some Norton thing I don’t really know who to trust. So that’s kind of annoying. But I did buy it to replace an older computer and it has done that."," March 13, 2023",5.0
Great laptop for school!,"To clarify, I have the 16GB RAM/512GB SSD/ Ryzen 5 5500U model. The battery life, camera quality, touch screen, and the power of this laptop are exactly what they should be for this price range. The speed and power of the laptop is what has impressed me the most. I am a music producer and I need at least 16GB of Ram and the 512GB of storage is pretty good as well. I also like to game a little. I was able to download and install over 60GB of musical software, which would usually take me a whole day or two to fully set up, in about 30 minutes. I am able to play Fortnite at around 30-40 fps, Valorant at around 60-80 fps, and Minecraft at around 60+ fps, which is plenty for my own needs right now, as I mostly use it for music production. So far it runs everything I bought it for smoothly and has at least met, if not exceeded my expectations. After reading many of the worse reviews, I tried to prepare myself for some flaws, but I honestly like everything about it. The brightness isn’t as bad as some people say either, 250 nits on this display is honestly plenty for probably 90% of the situations I use it in. Even if there is sunlight, I can still see the screen enough. It’s not like I’ll be gaming in the sunlight, if anything doing a musical performance outside during the day would potentially be a challenge but not impossible.

Great laptop with a touch screen.,"After six years, my old laptop was finally ready to go--I picked this one on recommendation from a friend who had a slightly older model. I'm VERY impressed with this computer so far. The battery life is the best I've had since my college computer, even if I'm on YouTube or drawing, the touch screen is pretty responsive (I've noticed that the top half-centimeter doesn't seem to respond, but that's consistent so I think it's supposed to be that way) and the touch controls are very sensible. The sound is good; I haven't had a chance to try the microphone or video yet. The camera seems fine, though! I love that the computer folds for drawing, too.

The only things I don't love are things that have changed between Microsoft 10 and 11, but that's not on the Lenovo. It automatically put OneDrive on (yuck) and some of the functionality of the apps have changed between operating systems. Again, though, nothing major, and that's not on Lenovo.

I then called Lenovo back and they said, ""take it to Geek Squad."" I asked for a supervisor and eventually he said he'd send a technician to my house. I waited all day on the appointed day and got a call from the supervisor saying it would happen the next day. Took off the morning of the next day and no show. Account showed ""waiting for parts."" Called and spent another half hour talking to Lenovo ""support"" and was told the technicians need to receive the right parts before they do the call so the technician is ""waiting for parts"" and will call to schedule. So why was I told there was a scheduled appointment already? The other option is to send my computer away for at least 10 days with no replacement offered.

Would not recommend for rendering, gaming, modeling, etc. Spend the extra money on a more durable and powerful PC."," January 31, 2023",2.0
,"After just 4 months the computer would not restart from hibernation or after turning the computer off. The reset button – that pinhole button on the side of the computer, was not functioning either. Lenovo support stated it is a hardware problem and instructed me to return it to them, BUT download our data and passwords first. I told them that was the problem, it would not start preventing me from downloading or backing anything up. They informed me the hard drive is wiped upon receipt by them, their suggestion was to take it to Best Buy to see if they could somehow start it. I learned after consulting with an IT friend, that SSD drives are notorious for these failures especially with problems on restarting from hibernation. I was eventually able to get it to start by letting the battery run out and restarting from a dead battery. I am sending it to Lenovo immediately."," March 31, 2023",1.0

,"I bought this same product but the 2020 version. Ryzen 7, 512Gb and 16Gb Ram.

The laptop performs well.
First disadvantage, the power cable that came with the laptop connects through the only USB Type-C port, even though the laptop comes with a dedicated power port.
My daughter have used it for university for two years and a half. Two weeks ago, the USB Type-C port does not work. I had to buy a power cable that connects to the dedicated power port to be able to charge the laptop.
On Sunday afternoon, I decide to check the Lenovo site to see if there were updated drivers. Among the 13 recommended drivers updates there was a bios update. I followed the instructions and applied the update to the bios.
The laptop rebooted and started to flash the bios and then went black. Windows did not boot up and it never booted again!
Not only that, but the bios update was so faulty that it bricked my daughter's laptop. Every time I turn on the laptop, nothing shows up on video. Can not even get to the BIOS with the special side button. Complete disaster. And because the laptop is out of warranty, There is a charge of $109 for a Lenovo technician to work on it plus shipping plus any other parts that it may require.
Lenovo is not taking responsability for these faulty bios updates that their website recommends!
And the Lenovo forums are filled with people with the same situation and they do not care.
If you buy Lenovo, DO NOT UPDATE the BIOS!"," March 22, 2023",5.0

,"I love my new laptop, but the colors displayed on screen are just ok...not very vibrant, average for my own use, and can be fixed a bit tilting the screen at a better angle. I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use. Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a ""bling"" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive.

,"I got the 15 inch, i needed this mostly for a good laptop, long battery life, USB C Charging, and price. I looked at several ""higher"" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.

Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare.

DETAILED REVIEW:
Asus's Chromebook is made from plastic that is nicely finished in a glossy silver, except for the bottom that is a matte silver plastic. The Asus is lightweight and easy to carry but it has a fairly large overall size that rivals my circa 2018 15"" MacBook Pro. Despite its lightweight, the Asus feels robust and does not bend or flex easily. The screen's hinges open and close smoothly and stay in your desired position well.

The larger size of the Asus means that you also get a large and nicely spaced keyboard. The keyboard is pleasant to type on and doesn't make much noise. The touch pad is also large and is sensitive to touching and tapping.

I had no issues with performance or battery life. The Asus is more than capable of surfing the web, word processing, and watching Hi-Def video. It's able to seamlessly play Netflix in a window while I simultaneously surf the web. With moderate usage, and the screen kept at a medium brightness, the battery easily lasts 8 hours. The Asus is silent in use and does not get hot.

Sadly the screen and speakers are lacking. The good parts of the screen are its lack of glare, decent brightness, and how well it performs when watching videos. Videos have vibrant but not over saturated colors, good black levels, and nice detail. The issues I take with the screen is that the color-shift is too blue and the viewing angle is narrow. Compared to Google's Pixelbook Go it is a subpar viewing experience. Still, for the price of the Asus, the screen is adequate. The speakers are less than adequate though. They are weak, tinny sounding, and placed where they are easy to block.

All in all... a fine Chromebook, with some caveats."," May 16, 2022",4.0

Horrible,"So far our family has been super impressed with this laptop. It's actually quite a bit larger than I was picturing full size screen and it's very thin and lightweight considering. Wait considering. It's not a touchscreen model which is fine I wasn't expecting it to be but if that's what you're looking for it's not this period period so far we've had no issues with functionality everything works as it's supposed to and it's running smoothly like a new computer should. Everything opens quickly and seemlessly.

This comes with the charger and any accessory you would need it's a basic silver color and could easily be decorated with stickers or laptop accessories.

The keyboard types very smoothly! It feels great typing on this as compared to my much smaller HP chromebook.. I'm honestly amazed azed at how nice it is considering the price!

This is an amazing value so far and I would highly recommend it for students or for anyone that needs a basic laptop to get them started with worker school.. We mostly wanted it to store files on and yon and use it as our home computer near my husband have personal computers but there's no computer for everyone's use and this seems perfect for that.

This doesn't come with some of the Bells and whistles that some of the more expensive brands might come with but honestly the base programs that it comprehends stalled on it are more than you need for everyday use. My daughter has used it to do school work on already and had no issues. It connected to the Internet without any problem and the battery stays charged a lot longer than my husband's computer does.

Like I said before the screen is huge way bigger than I was expecting and the display looks really nice. Great for watching videos on or possibly editing photos.

Super happy with this order and honestly for the price you just can't beat it any time you can get a decent laptop for under $300 you found an amazing deal I would absolutely order this again and highly recommend it to anyone"," April 16, 2022",5.0

The keyboard is springy, and it has decent travel. The touchpad is decent. Frankly, for the price, you're getting a nice little rig. It's not going to compete with a full featured Windows 11 laptop, but it's good enough for daily use and basic needs."," May 31, 2022",5.0
Great basic laptop,"This is the first Chromebook I have owned, although I have used some before. In some ways this Chromebook is better than comparable models and in some ways it's worse. On the positive side; it has 64GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, two USB-C ports, and a full HD screen (1920 X 1080). On the negative side it has an outdated processor (Intel Celeron N3350), WiFi 5, and Bluetooth 4.2. I don't think it would have cost more than a few dollars extra to include the latest WiFi and Bluetooth chipsets, so I don't understand that decision. Fortunately, although the processor is slow, Chrome OS isn't a very demanding operating system. In the tests I have done so far, the performance has been fine. If all you want to do is browse the web, watch videos, or use Google apps; a Chromebook like this one is more than enough for most people. I think this is an excellent computer for a student. If it gets broken or lost, you're only out $250 instead of over $1,000 for most Apple or Windows laptops."," April 22, 2022",5.0
,"Overall, this is a decent laptop/Chromebook for the price. It really should be thought of as more of a glorified tablet with a keyboard, as it won’t be running any demanding software, but it is a great entry-level laptop for the price. Pros: Great price, fairly lightweight, seems pretty functional. If you break it or lose it, it wasn’t a huge investment ;)
Cons: No FN keys (can set them up in settings, but they are not printed on the keys so you’ll have to just know which one is which), no number pad, WiFi strength isn’t great (low signal in areas where my other computer still has normal signal)."," April 22, 2022",5.0

,"When I first got the Chromebook it worked for like a day and then died. It wouldn't charge the screen wouldn't turn on it just wouldn't work. Because my Amazon invoice says I paid $0 for this because it was a gift Asus wouldn't help me because technically I didn't pay for it even though I had all the information necessary. This isn't the first time I've had issues with an Asus product let alone Asus customer service. The first day when the Chromebook worked it was wonderful and exactly what I needed. It was a bit slow with Android apps but I didn't really need Android apps to begin with on the Chromebook. Basic web browsing and maybe discord.

All in all avoid Asus products because they are shoddy quality and their customer service team absolutely does not care. One of the worst experiences with customer service and laptops I've ever had"," May 25, 2022",5.0

I left it and came back to it a few hours later and it just will not charge.

,"I have the Lenovo G50. It is what it is, another laptop running on the always unstable Windows OS.

CONS:

What is frustrating about these series of Lenovo is the CUSTOMER satisfaction experience, the WARRANTY, and the MANUFACTURING DESIGN. All three elements can be combined or individualized for an absolute disgrace and disappointment.

The manufacturing design is the culprit here. Poor quality elements to the computer make it flimpsy, inadequate for traveling purposes. It will crack if you carry it here and there. The monitor chassis is as weak as any plastic products you would get at a Dollar Store or a Dollar Tree or Dollar General. Even when you pickup these laptops from a second, you can feel the weight of the battery pack on the back of the system creating structural stress.

I can't say enough to let you know and Lenovo about my disappointment with the workmanship. The price was alright for what I (you will get) got.

SOME POSSITIVE POINTS:

It starts super fast but this may not be due to the manufacturer.

Hope this helps. Happy shopping"," March 3, 2016",1.0

Good so far,"I was a little skeptical about this laptop considering the price, but I am amazed!

Three things right out the gate: 1) It's listed as Abyss Blue but it's actually a silver/metallic color which I'm not angry about because it looks good. 2) It's listed as 14"" but it's actually 15.6"" which again I'm not angry about lol 3) It's stated as Windows 10 Home for the operating system but it comes with Windows 11 which this is my first time using the OS and I haven't run into any issues with it so once again I'm not angry!

Now onto the rest: I read a review in which their laptop didn't have the correct graphics card in it. I can confirm mine does indeed have the 6 core, 12 thread AMD Ryzen 5 5500U. In fact, everything else is as stated in the description and it's wonderful! It is quick to start up and all programs so far run quickly. I haven't tried playing a newer game on it yet so that will be the biggest test for this laptop that I would be able to put it through. Otherwise, it operates the web and my usual desktop applications perfectly fine.

The few negatives I have: 1) The sound is not the best as the speakers are inside the elbow where the screen meets the body. 2) Even though the keyboard has a full ten key pad, the enter key is small and I find my finger hitting the 4 key rather than the enter some times (just have to learn this keyboard better) 3) The battery life seems decent. I'm taxing this system more than I am my work laptop, but it still seems to drain slightly faster than I expect.

Overall I'm very happy I got this laptop so far as it has exceeded my expectations at pretty much every turn."," November 19, 2022",3.0
,"First off, don't let the title scare you, it's a great deal. The screen, unlike previous iterations, is gorgeous for the price - crisp and detailed. You can probably find the specs elsewhere complaining about SRGB coverage, but for the average user, sub $500, it's great. Seems like it gets close to 300 nits, definitely bright enough indoors. Keyboard is very nice, not MacBook Air or the like, but very close - much better than Acer/Asus/Samsung. Trackpad along the same lines, very good overall, if you really want to nitpick, the clicking of it wasn't the best on the edges for right/left click. Sound was decent, definitely a laptop speaker and does not get too loud. Fan noise isn't noticeable unless you're used to absolute quiet, the fans spun up under load when setting things up and windows updates, quiet and not grating on the ears. Build quality won't wow anyone at the coffee shop but the plastic resembles brushed metal and it's appealing over, say, the millionth grey laptop. Moderately serviceable under the hood, with one ram stick being soldered on (4 gb). Ignore the other reviews bashing Amazon's delivery service instead of the product itself, this is a sleeper Windows laptop. Highly recommended for research/browsing, writing, and light gaming."," August 22, 2021",3.0

,"The Lenovo Ideapad computers are a good line of products for school and light duty work. The keys are really nice. Screen is reasonable and depending on which model you get, it may have upgradable options for RAM and storage. Also depending on the specific model, it can have a metal frame instead of plastic which is nice.

The glaring issue is I selected one model(very specifically), and was confirmed a different one. Since I knew I added the correct one and in the cart it had shown the correct one, I believed this to be a display error since the one displayed was the ""default"" model when you clicked on the Lenovo Product. On arrival, I got a completely different model. What I wanted to order- IdeaPad 3 Ryzen 5500U, 12 GB RAM, 512 Storage, WIN 10. What arrived, IdeaPad 5 Intel i5, 8GB RAM, 256 Storage, Win11.
I have reached out to the fulfilling company to try and find some resolution.

,"This is a nice laptop but it doesn't have the AMD R5 5500U processor. It has a one year older Intel i5 which only has 4 cores not the 6 the AMD has. To it's credit it does have a 512 SSD drive instead of the 256 advertised. It also has Windows 11 (which I HATE) while the product description says W10. At the end of the day I decided to keep it just because the hassle of returning and getting what I paid for wasn't worth my effort. But the Ryzen is a better, 1 year newer, processor. And I could have stored stuff on a USB if that was an issue.

The item comes in a completely blank box. Nothing suggests it came from Lenovo. No documents for setup, warranty or care. Very sketchy all around from this seller and not what I wanted but the i5-10210U which only has 4 cores can handle what I need it for.

"Good Computer Line, Terrible fulfillment process","As context, my prior laptop was a Macbook Pro, and I was looking to get away from Macs and have a functional replacement to do office work (i.e., MS Office type stuff) and telehealth/zoom meetings. I figured I did not need to spend a ton of money to get that. I really, really wish I had spent more. The camera is not very good, and I've gotten feedback from others that the mic is not good either. I could get peripherals to replace those, but I don't want to have to do that. The screen is great- wide screen is so much more functional than my old laptop, but the quality is just not what I have been accustomed to. The colors are wan comparatively, and it's harder to use in different lighting situations. It also needs to be at just the right angle to see colors properly. I do love that it has a keyboard/keypad combo, and the keyboard itself is satisfying for typing. The trackpad is meh but gets the job done. Better with an external mouse. Finally, the laptop is light and seems to run well overall (especially after removing some of the bloatware installed on it).

Overall, it's fine for work that requires MS Office and general web surfing, but I am really disappointed with its performance on Zoom and Teams, and I now have my old, dying Mac hooked up for that purpose, and I switch between them.

Good for the price,"This is a basic AMD laptop, with major hiccups. While using this laptop for a year now, I have noticed a few major hiccups that interrupt my usage. I don't know if there is a defect with my laptop, or the AMD processor, but I am really disappointed with this AMD laptop:

1) The Bluetooth connectivity goes out all the time when you try to connect to an already established device. You have to remove the device and make a new connection.

2) The internet connection gets interrupted from time to time, where the speed slows down to .8mbps; When compared to other devices on my WiFi, the internet speed is fine averaging 110mbps.

3) Each time a launch any application, it shows some kind of ""installing application"" message before the application opens up. It doesn't last long, just makes it slow to open up applications.

Perfect laptop for every day use,I bought the laptop put my profile on and used it solely for YouTube and indeed job searching. It blue screened the next day and I’ve been fighting with Lenovo to send me a replacement or even fix the one I have. Once I got them to finally send me a box to ship it to them in they tried to sell me an extended warranty. If I planned on wasting my life using this dumpster fire of a laptop that would be a no brainer. The second I have the money I’ll be buying a better laptop with an intel processor.

,"First off, this is a really good laptop. It's using an APU that, as of the time of this writing, is basically brand new, a Ryzen 5 5500U. I have an older laptop with a Ryzen 7 2700U and this one outperforms it in every way. It's got 8 GB of non-user replaceable RAM and a 256GB NVME drive. Also of note is the backlit keyboard which every laptop SHOULD have these days, but many still don't. This also has a standard 1080p screen, it's non-touch.

So the screen! I thought at 14 inches it might have been a bit too small, but after a day or two of using it, it was totally fine. After several weeks of using it, I got completely used to it and appreciate how light and portable the laptop is. As far as viewing angles go, they're pretty amazing. Literally the best I've ever seen on a device in this price range. The material is really matte and you can expect next to no reflections visible on this thing. 1080p is also more than fine for the size of the screen, in my opinion. Overall, this is a big win, in this area.

The hardware inside the laptop is really good, but that's where we have some room for improvement. It's got 8 gigs of RAM, in dual channel mode, soldered onto the board. This means you can't add your own RAM. 8 GB is a tad low these days and I really wish they would have bumped it up to either 12 or 16. Likewise, the 256GB NVME drive is not user replaceable. You do get a few USB ports and a (full sized, oddly enough) SD card port, though, so adding storage isn't a problem.

The trackpad is also really nice on this device and I no issues with accidentally touching it with my palms while using it.

The only other minor downside I would say this device has is that it could have really used an ethernet port. It's super common to not include them on laptops these days and the wi-fi performance is fine, but sometimes I work with wired routers and I unfortunately can't use this very portable to test them.

A few words about performance. I'm not going to go into benchmarks here, those are all over the net already, so I'm just going to talk about real world usability. Productivity apps run totally fine. They may not be ideal because of the screen size, but you won't run into any performance issues using stuff like Word, Excel, etc. When it comes to media, there's nothing I tested that this laptop doesn't handle perfectly. YouTube, Netlfix and the other streaming apps run and look fine.

And while it's not a gaming laptop, you'll find that you can run quite a few modern games, with reduced settings, at pretty good framerates. I spent about 30 hours playing games on this to test it and had no problems running anything. It got a little hot during gameplay, but much less so than most other laptops I've used over the last 10 years. The refresh rate maxes at 60 fps, which considering the GPU, any higher would be a waste anyway.

Last quick thing I'll talk about is sound. This unit has speakers that fire forward and down a bit, they're on the front side of the base of the unit. So, front firing speakers are another plus, because they're down and forward a bit you don't get the best possible sound. It's better than bottom or rear-firing speakers, but having them on the base or hinge area would have been ideal.

In the end, this Lenovo IdeaPad is a really nice laptop and for the right customer will be perfect. The right customer is someone with basic computing needs, that wants to use it for some media and wants to play some lower to mid-range games on it. The lack of upgradability means it's not idea for power users who would want to add RAM and higher storage capacity. For me personally, I wish it had a touch more ram, a 512gb NVME drive, and an ethernet port, but even as is, the performance is really good and I'm really happy with it as a portable secondary computer."," August 5, 2021",5.0
El cargador no se conecta bien a la laptop,"I originally picked this laptop up with hope to use it as a testing laptop for my software I develop. However it ended up that my dads laptop broke around the time I got this one and I ended up migrating his data to this laptop. I didn't use the SSD that came with this laptop and instead I installed a different SSD entirely (also NVMe) to clone his laptops data to and then port it to this machine.
This was supposed to be his ""backup"" laptop for a couple weeks but now he has used it for almost 6 months. Which is basically around the time I got it in.
He said that the keyboard is good, but he wishes it was backlit like his previous laptop. While I admit this is a budget entry laptop, many laptops even around lower price points like this at least have some sort of white backlighting....
This laptop DOES NOT support SATA drives in the NVMe M.2 slot (it doesn't have other slots) as I tried to slot in my dads SATA M.2 and it simply wouldn't read it at all. So I had to get another NVMe drive to get the machine to boot.
Fingerprint reader is very fast and accurate, making it easy to login.

One of my dads biggest gripes is that the screen is ""not so bright, especially during the day"" as my dad regularly does work in his car on the way to appointments or waiting for his buyers to meet with him. He notes that it is very difficult for him to get work done in the car during the day because of the lack of brightness here. Color accuracy is nothing to write home about, however it is nothing to scoff at either with it being reasonably color accurate especially for everyday office and light media consumption tasks.
When it comes to the memory, we haven't ever booted the laptop with the memory that it came with. I took the 16GB out of my dads old laptop and put it into this one, so its running at 2666mhz but it has 16GB Ram. This laptop came out of the box with a single 3200mhz stick of DDR4. Which makes it prime for upgrades. Taking the bottom of the laptop off is a bit interesting as there are many plastic tabs that have to be pressed and the bottom ""snaps around"" the top, which makes accessing all the tabs quite interesting.
The rest of the laptop seems to be fine, even if the webcam is also pretty basic 720p in this ""internet conference"" world. My father has an external webcam which he uses from time to time for longer conferences, since this camera isn't the greatest.
Performance is also good, handily beating his older 2500U at literally every task and then some. However it is important to note that while this is a ""5000 series"" APU laptop chip, it is not Zen3 but the previous Zen2 design. Personally this is not an issue for the types of tasks that this laptop would be performing, but when it comes to things like gaming, Zen3 would be faster. However since this laptop doesn't have a dGPU anyway and only light games can be played, it might be better that it has Zen2 as I have personally found Zen2 laptops to have a bit better battery life when done right.
In terms of battery life; this laptop has way better battery life vs my dads old laptop allowing him to leave it on almost all day in a trade show booth without needing to charge the battery. Something that wasn't even close to possible with his old unit.
All in all after almost 6 months of use my dad is happy with this laptop although he still misses his older laptop with the touch screen (btw this unit doesn't have one, but you should know from the specs) and backlit keyboard."," December 12, 2021",5.0
,"This is a great little laptop! It is thinner, lighter and faster than my old laptop, and the price is outstanding!

Display: The 1920x1080 screen resolution allows me to view web pages without scrolling left and right and even my older eyes can easily read text on the 14” screen by setting the screen scaling to 150%. The screen brightness, color, and contrast are top notch. I like the matt black bordered, non-touch screen with anti-glare finish since I prefer no distractions from glare or fingerprints. The laptop uses integrated graphics so 2GB of the 8GB main memory is dedicated to graphics leaving 6GB available for Windows and programs. Movies and videos stream well on the laptop but it will not run games like Crysis that require a discrete graphics card. I was able to run the 2016 version of Doom and the graphics scrolled quickly and smoothly. The positive side of this is the CPU with integrated graphics is very frugal (15W) and you can surf while streaming music for 9 hours on a full charge!

CPU: The AMD Ryzen 5 5500U has a Passmark CPU rating of 14,123 which makes it much faster than my old laptop and faster than my 8th gen i7 desktop computer! My gaming i7 laptop beats its performance, but the gaming machine only runs 3 to 4 hours while not gaming compared to this PC’s 9 hours so you can carry and use this laptop without constantly worrying about finding an outlet to recharge it.

Look and feel: The dark blue and black styling is stylish! Although there is a lot of plastic in its build, the trackpad and area surrounding the keyboard have a nice, smooth, brushed aluminum feel, and the backlit keyboard is large enough for my big hands. The keyboard is easy to type on and the trackpad is responsive to taps and gestures and tracks well. My one complaint is the trackpad does not have separate left and right mouse buttons but rather integrates these functions into the bottom left and right corners of the pad. This was a “feature” of the ThinkPad 440 that made drag and drop very difficult and almost made us stop using Lenovos at work. The buttons were added back to later ThinkPad versions. I wish the industry as a whole would realized the importance of having separate left and right mouse buttons! Not everyone wants to carry a mouse with their laptop!

Testing: I used stress test software to run the CPU at 100% and the GPU at 90% for 2 hours. After a few seconds the CPU temp climbed from 40C to 50C but then the cooling fan spooled up and kept the CPU at a moderate 61C for the remainder of the test. The bottom of the laptop got slightly warm but not hot. The fan can be heard at higher speeds but is not objectionable. I did not even notice it in normal PC use (spooling videos/music, using Libre Office, surfing the net). The laptop worked well handling large spreadsheets with no annoying pauses while loading or scrolling through them and copies files quickly from USB devices.

Over all, I am very happy with this laptop. It is powerful, light and inexpensive, and would be great for college or home use. Since it is a 14”, it has no numeric keypad, but an external keyboard and mouse would solve that problem and would give you real right and left mouse buttons instead of having to use the corners of the trackpad. It will be my primary laptop and I will probably just carry it with a wireless mouse for most jobs. It only has 2 USB-A ports , but it does have a USB-C port which I use a 4 port USB-A hub in to give me 6 USB-A ports for my older peripherals. It also has a full size HDMI port so I can plug it into an external monitor or TV if I need a bigger display! It also has a fingerprint reader built in to the power button which works well with Windows Hello, and a webcam with integrated shutter for privacy.

I cannot give it 5 stars due to the lack of trackpad buttons, no drive access light so you can see when it's working on something instead of being locked up (a pet peeve), and limited USB-A ports, but it is a solid 4 stars and well worth the money."," July 31, 2021",5.0
,"First off this laptop is very lightweight and comfortable to carry in a bag or just around. I love the feature for fingerprint login on Windows 10. So much faster then even typing a pin. This laptop from Lenovo featuring an AMD 5500U processor/graphics card performs everyday tasks quite well. It is absolutely fantastic for web browsing. Playing even 4k videos on its 1080p monitor easily. Boot times from its internal NVME drive is fast and easily under 10 seconds.

Gaming Performance:
I ran a few benchmarks on this Lenovo laptop. It scored quite well on Geekbench 5, User Benchmarks and even held its own on 3D Mark. Lets discuss gaming. If you are not familiar with APUs they are regular processors with an added section that acts like a discrete video card. It can render basic 3D games well enough at fairly ok speed. Its using the system ram to do so so while gaming other tasks may suffer.
This laptop with the 5500U is effectively the low end of the current gen AMD APUs. The numbers it is pushing appear to line up with the previous gen TOP APU. Which is pretty common for manufacturers to take older gen processors and rename them. That being said it is a fantastic overall processor in this laptop.

Battery Life:
I have an old Lenovo gaming laptop with an i5, 16GB of RAM and a GTX 880 (Yes its a weird one but was only in laptops back then). Even when the i5 was new it only got around 2 hours of battery life. Now a days it gets about 30 minutes.
This energy sipping AMD 5500U processor is absolutely amazing. I used it all day yesterday unplugged. I did some general surfing of the web and then last night I used it with my web based gaming site to play D&D. It lasted the whole session and as of me writing this has 28% battery life. I am not used to this level of battery. With my other Lenovo I basically always left it plugged in which meant it felt less like a laptop and more like a portable desktop.

Design:
The design is nice. I did manage to get fingerprints on the backside of the smooth painted top. Not a huge deal, but if that sort of thing bothers you then might want to get a cover for it. I REALLY like the feel of the keyboard. The keys are tactile and responsive. Not too much deck flex (of course I am a light fingered typist). The keyboard is backlit.
The screen is anti-glare and has a really good vibrant color. Good viewing angles as I think it is an IPS panel, it definitely does not act like a TN panel.

Tips for performance:
If you want more oomph out of this laptop, go into the bios (DEL at startup). On the first page at the bottom there is AMD Balanced Mode selected by default. Set it to AMD Performance Mode and it will boost the clocks up. Not really needed but if you are a power user this is how you can max the clocks. By the way I ran it all day with the clocks boosted and that shows just how good the battery is.

Conclusion:
This relatively budget laptop is light, powerful and more than enough for basic daily use. It boasts big performance with a huge battery and a low wattage processor. Taken care of this would last you for many years. Highly recommended."," July 14, 2021",5.0
Touch Screen,"This 2021 version of the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is excellent, one of the best back to school offerings at the moment, for around $450 you would have a hard time finding anything better. I have a fairly small YT channel, but I have been in computers for over 25 years, so my tech experience is above average and I really am impressed by this version of the IdeaPad 3. There are a lot of positives that are worth mentioning and just a few minor negatives that are not preventing me from recommending it to everyone that is looking for a well balanced, powerful and inexpensive laptop. Before moving to the positives and negatives, just a few words about the packaging, as every other budget friendly laptop the package and presentation are kept to the modest lower level without too much flair, and is just fine. The laptop is well protected inside with packing foam, so even if the box gets abused in shipping the contents are well protected, inside there is the laptop, the power adapter/charger and small user guide plus warranty information booklet. 
Positives:
- New powerful Ryzen 5 5500U - I had some experience with the older generations Ryzen mobile processors, and I new that this latest version has to be good, and I was not wrong, 6 cores and 12 threads, plus 11MB of cache are delivering a great performance, not only for office, media and school work, but even for some content creation and even gaming, impressive. - Adequate cooling solution - even in very stressful situations, playing games or rendering videos, the temperature of the CPU rarely even touched 85C, with 23C room temperature and office work it never went over 60C.- Easy to upgrade memory, storage and WiFI card - even though the laptop comes with 8GB of DDR4 ram (with 2GB reserved for the Radeon graphics chip), upgrading to larger memory capacity is very easy, all you need to remove the 9 Philips screws from the bottom lid and all the components are exposed. Same goes for the internal Nvme storage (Western Digital 256GB) and the WiFi card (Realtek card by default).- Very nice 1080P, IPS, mate screen - love the 14'' size screen, which is full HD and is delivering a great image, especially for the price.- Physical privacy shutter over the webcam - one of the best Lenovo features, with today's privacy concerns, it's always better to have a physical cover over the web camera.- Great Lenovo keyboard - easy and comfortable to type on and in addition it has two stages of backlight.- Power button and fingerprint reader in one - great to see fingerprint biometrics for Windows hello, even in a budget offering like this one.- Plenty of ports - HDMI, USB-C, USB3, SD card reader.- Plays Fortnite - It's impressive that this new 5500U in combination with the integrated Radeon graphics, can deliver over 80FPS in Fortnite, all settings on low and 3D on maximum.- Compact and light enough to take on the road or on a plane.- Accurate touchpad without any major issues.
Negatives:
- Plastic body - most of the negatives are nitpicking, since for this price, compromises had to be made. - Sound can be better, but for the price, it's fine.- Barrel style plug for the charger, with kind of a short cable - ideally I would have loved to see a USB-C charger, but not all that bad.- 4GB of ram soldered on the motherboard, making upgrades somewhat limited, personally I replaced the included 4GB slot with 8GB stick and now the total is 12GB, better for work and gaming. - The battery life can be better.- The built in webcam is only 720P and the quality is subpar- The touchpad is a bit rattly.

Overall, I like this laptop a lot and will recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good inexpensive computer for school or work."," August 12, 2021",5.0
,"I have owned my idea pad for almost a year, and I hate it and can't wait to replace it. There is just one tiny area on the touchpad for left-clicking; touch anywhere else, and the screen doesn't respond or, worse, does some weird thing. Screen constantly jumps around, shows stuff that I didn't click on when I'm trying to do something, zooms in or out without my telling it to...

Great little laptop with a Ryzen 5 5500U... with one minor downside,"I was surprised how nice this laptop is.I was expecting this to be the laptop I threw into my suitcase for travel. The one that gave me what I needed on the road but nothing much more. It is priced like a low-end laptop but performance is more mid-range.

The FHD (1920X1080) screen is sharp with good graphics processing. I like the very thin bezel. Color rendition appears to be quite accurate. The top bezel has a 720p Webcam that is nice and sharp (given the resolution).

The combination of the Ryzen 5 CPU, 8GB RAM and 256GB NVMe SSD make this a snappy machine for office like uses: MS Office, web apps and browsing, Streaming video (you know, training videos, right?), and piggy applications like QuickBooks. The keyboard has the too common ‘chicklet’ keys that I don’t really like but have gotten used to. The touchpad is very responsive and gives me no problems with tracking the heel of my hand when I’m typing.

There is a dedicated power port, 2 USB-A ports (1 USB-3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps) and one USB-2.0), 1 HDMI 1.4b port, 1 USB-C port Gen 1 (5Gbps), 1 3.5mm Audio jack and a SD card reader. The USB-C port cannot be used to power this laptop or to drive a USB-C compatible monitor. You must use the round plug power adapter. I would like to have seen a second USB-C port that can accept power and another USB-A 3.2 port.

On the right hand side is the “Novo Button” which lets me get into the BIOS/Boot Menu before the OS boots. NICE! This is one of the things I’ve hated about most UEFI boot systems I’ve used. It’s hard to get to the BIOS settings. This is a big plus for me.

The laptop is very portable. Light and easy to carry around. The connection to my 5Ghz WiFi worked great and was very reliable and speedy. Bluetooth 5 connections are effortless to setup and reliable as I would expect. I like the fingerprint reader discretely built into the power button.

All considered this inexpensive laptop gave me a lot more than I expected. Still it’s a low end laptop with slower Gen-1 USB 3.2 on the USB-C and one of the 2 USB-A ports and the USB-C port is quite limited for power-input and display support. Even so I think it’s a good value for a sub-$500 (as of this review) laptop. That’s why I’m giving it 5 stars: good value."," September 3, 2021",5.0
,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this laptop as I haven't ever owned any of the lower end Lenovo machines in the past. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It's compact and lightweight, great for toting around in your bag without having to have a giant laptop with you. The screen is very nice, although I wish it had slightly higher resolution - but it's ok for most productivity and streaming applications. The keyboard is also very responsive and nice to type on. Trackpad is good, although not as great as something like a Macbook - but this isn't pretending to be that.

Pros
----------------------
* Pretty powerful, the Ryzen processor and Radeon graphics chip are surprisingly good
* Can upgrade the memory, there is one slot that has 4GB module in it - I swapped out for an 8GB giving me a total of 12GB of memory
* Snappy experience when using, not full of a ton of bloatware - there are a few Lenovo apps but not a ton
* Boots up and goes to sleep super fast, very good user experience
* Nice assortment of ports on the side, including SD card reader etc...
* Fingerprint scanner in the power button is nice for easy unlocking and access

Cons
---------------------
* The overall build quality is ""plastic"" feeling - it looks like metal, but it's plastic. The body will flex if you put stress on the screen hinges, or the front sides. But it's not a huge deal, just something I noticed
* The thermals are so-so on this, if you are using it a bunch on your lap - it gets pretty hot. If using on a desk or normal table etc, then it's not bad. The fan is quiet and isn't always running which is good.
* Speakers aren't great. You'd be better off with headphones or a better set of desktop speakers if sound quality is a big deal for you

All in all though I was very happy with this device, especially at this price point. The overall package, while having some downsides is a great machine. Battery life seems to be pretty good as well. I haven't yet run a stress test on it - but may do that in the future and update this review.

Great Portable Laptop,"Play Video
 The Ideapad 3 14 is a very good budget laptop. It comes with a 6 cores 12 threats Ryzen 5500U, a Radeon 7 Graphics, 8GB RAM and 256GB NVMe SSD.
The Laptop has a bright 14"" 1080P screen, backlit keyboard, USB C and fingerprint reader.

Besides handling every day tasks, this IdeaPad 3 14 could also handle photo, video editing and a bit of gaming too.

You could even use it as your work laptop. My work provided laptop, with a 10th Gen Intel Core i7, performs worse and it costs more than twice the price of the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14.
It case you want to use it for work, it has some security built in, such as TPM 2.0, Core isolation, (virtualization-based) and fingerprint reader. Kind of hard to find a laptop below seven hundred, with fingerprint reader, WiFi 6 and a backlit keyboard.

If the laptop is used for video editing or gaming, I would suggest to swapping the 4GB RAM module for a least 8GB module...a 16GB RAM module would be ideal. The Micron 4GB removable memory module runs at 3200MHz (22-22-22-52-74) at 1.20 V.
Also by getting into the BIOS, under 'Configuration' the Lenovo Ideapad 14 could be set to 'Extreme Performance', which will allow the laptop to perform even better. By default the laptop is set to 'Intelligent cooling' which allows 15W max power usage. Enabling 'Extreme Performance' could allow as much as 30W.
I applaud Lenovo for allowing end users to unleash the full power of a Ryzen 5500U APU.

Take in consideration that increasing the power that the APU can use, it will decrease the battery run time. For video editing and gaming that could be a good trade-off but for every day tasks, such as web browsing and word processing the 15W default is plenty.

The Lenovo is using a Samsung PM991a M.2 256GB NVMe SSD, which is not slouch. The SSD could hit read speeds of 3100 MB/sand write speeds of 1300MB/s.
The laptop powers on in 10.2 seconds and powers off in just 5 seconds flat.
I clocked the USB C port at 8.2 Gbps, that's a gig per second, so it could transfer some serious data.

The touchpad and keyboard are decent and the 4054mAh battery lasted 6 hours and 43 seconds of mixed use (browsing the web, watching YouTube videos, reading and answering emails and video conferencing.).

The 720p webcam, is as good as you can get on any laptop, even those costing twice as much. It is good for video conferencing, but for streaming, a twenty bucks 1080p webcam looks a lot better.

The M.2 2242 SSD and the RAM are upgradeable. It supports up to 20GB of RAM (4GB soldered) and M.2 2242 and 2280 sizes.
It has a Lenovo WiFi card supporting 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz and WiFi 6 GHz

There isn't much installed besides some Lenovo useful apps and McAfee security.
The Lenovo Vantage app helps to manage the laptop settings, system status, information, performance and updates from one location.

I ran several benchmarks with the laptop's default 15W and these are the results below.
I also ran the same benchmarks with the laptop set to 'Extreme Performance'. Watch the video for comparison.

My wife's Inspiron 14, with similar configuration it is a bit heavier, larger, it lacks fingerprint reader, it lacks WiFi 6, has lower performance and it costs two hundred more.

For less than five hundred you could get a capable laptop, that performs well, can handle every day task with ease and even handles some photo, video editing and a bit of gaming.

I would have like Lenovo to move to USB C charging, so we carry less charging bricks and cables and help with e-waste."," July 21, 2021",5.0
,"I’ve spent a bit of time using this laptop and right off the bat I’m going to say I think it is a pretty good one.

I started with my usual removing everything that isn’t in a standard Windows install including the included antivirus and Lenovo utilities that I wouldn’t use anyway. There wasn’t too much extra to remove. I then went to the Lenovo support site and let it detect the laptop and install the service bridge and system update software so I could just go and check for updates when I wanted to.

I can use the keyboard and touchpad just fine with minimal errors. They aren’t the best but they aren’t bad either. The keyboard has a white backlight with off/low/hi settings available.

The power button has an integrated fingerprint reader that works well enough. It isn’t the best one I’ve used, it misfires sometimes and I need to lift and reset my finger. If it doesn’t work the first time it usually only takes one lift and retouch to get it to work. I’ve tried retraining several times and I guess it is just the way it is. I have other laptops with readers that don’t exhibit this problem.

The webcam is usable but won’t win any awards. It isn’t the best but also not the worst I’ve seen. It does have an integrated lens cover which is nice.

The laptop looks good but being a dark smooth plastic it does show fingerprints. I wouldn’t say it is a fat PS3 level fingerprint magnet but they will show. In the picture that I attached it was exposed a little longer because of the lower light in the room so the dust looks worse than it really is.

The screen on mine has low backlight bleed. It is probably one of the best panels I’ve had for minimal bleed. I just don’t see any during regular use or on my desktop with a solid black background. It also looks good to me out of the box. Color might be pushed just a tad high but overall things just look right and I haven’t felt the need to mess around with it.

I did try plugging my monitor’s USB C cable in and got no display through it. It would also be nice if it could charge off it too but it didn't. So it is just a plain USB C port.

In everyday use, this laptop is super responsive and feels good to use. Unless you have some particular workload in mind that you know will be super heavy this is a great processor. I am accustomed to using a high-end PC. I have a Ryzen 5900x with 32GB and a PCIe gen 4 NVMe drive. I can bang away at websites and jump from this to that on this laptop with no problems and I don’t feel held back.

This laptop has 8GB of memory and unfortunately, half of it is soldered to the motherboard. I will say though I was pretty impressed with how this handless with 8GB. I used it as it comes for the review but I did just order a 16GB stick to add some more just because.

When it comes to gaming don’t underestimate this laptop or any others with this line of Ryzen processors in them. I don’t know about you but I’ve been accumulating games on Steam since it launched. I almost always add something during a Steam sale. Then I don’t always get around to playing what I got right away and it gets left behind. I have a very large catalog of older games. That is where this laptop comes in. I have found that a lot of my games play great. I finally got around to playing Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine with an Xbox controller on this laptop and had a good time doing it with everything turned on.

I also found that it looks like AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution is going to work to make new games that support it also playable on this laptop. I was able to download the newest AMD driver and play Resident Evil Village with the laptop plugged in, set to the extreme mode in the UEFI, everything turned on in the game, FSR set to performance, textures set to 2GB, and all other settings to medium. I was getting anywhere from 30 to 60 FPS with the average looking to be in the low 40s. I played from jumping out of the burning house in the village to where the daughters capture you and chain you up. It was very playable with minimal stutter from texture loading and as viewed on this laptop’s screen it looked and played good, very impressive. I could probably make it smoother by dropping to 1GB of textures but I didn’t want to go back that far.

Overall with the price and how everything comes together with this laptop I would absolutely recommend it. It isn’t perfect but I think overall you won’t be disappointed.

Update 8/11/21: I swapped the 4GB memory module out for a Crucial (CT16G4SFRA32A) 16GB. It wasn't difficult to open the laptop. You have to take the screws out and then use a thin plastic spudger on the side of the laptop near one of the speakers. I worked it in but didn't push it in too far and then slid it along the side. You can feel the indents along the way. When you get it in an indent push it just a little further in and then gently twist until the clip pops. Keep it slightly lifted with your fingers and then move a little further with the spudger working your way around the laptop doing the same. Once you get past the first corner the rest goes pretty easy. Just keep being careful and lift as evenly around it as you can so you don't break the plastic clips. I was pretty careful and surprisingly didn't even leave any pry marks. Once you get it open the memory is under the metal can that has black foam on it to the left of the SSD. You just have to carefully lift it up and it will come off. Swap the memory sticks and replace everything and it was good to go with no problems. Windows is showing 20GB."," July 30, 2021",5.0
"A capable budget laptop, that performs well...better than more expensive units.","I have a monster gaming PC, but I like to have something mobile. This Lenovo more than meets my expectations and needs.

Observations:

1. I love the light weight and thin profile. It makes for easy mobility.
2. I don't use this as a gaming PC, but I did download a few games to test them out. It has no problem running games like Minecraft and Slime Rancher and less graphically-intensive games. Given that the hard drive is only 250 GB, I wouldn't want to run any larger games on it anyway.
3. The battery life is more than acceptable. I was able to surf, watch YouTube and work on documents for hours.
4. It does come with some unnecessary software and I don't like being prompted to install things like McAfee.

Dislikes

1. I miss the ten-key. My muscle memory keeps reaching to the right.

All in all, this is a super laptop. I couldn't be more pleased. A previous Lenovo I owned had real difficulty staying connected to the internet, but I've had no issues with this one."," July 27, 2021",5.0
,"This laptop is a solid budget option for those looking for great performance at a lower cost. The Ryzen 5500U is a 6 core 12 thread CPU which is powerful and efficient. As a reference, this CPU runs cooler than my Intel i10 counterpart and has better battery life. The Radeon graphics 7 is good, but be mindful that this is not geared towards those who want to play games at high settings. It is able to play games, but depending on the game, in game settings will need to be adjusted.

For a backup workstation laptop, this one is great for when I am traveling or on the go. It is light weight and small which makes it ideal for me when I am away from the office. The battery life is good especially for what I do which is typical Office apps, email, and some minor graphics work.

For a budget laptop, this is a nice solution for school or just about any other type of tasks you throw at it. Overall from my usage of this laptop over the past few weeks, I recommend this based on the performance and price. The Ryzen 5500U CPU performs above its price point and really shines in this laptop."," July 25, 2021",5.0

I have installed Ansys Mechanical on it and have not issues demoing my models. For most of my demos I plug into a overhead monitor via the HDMI cable so it's not like my customers are crowded around my small screen. Camera is descent but to be fair I've never seen a laptop camera that ever been very good. I use an external hard drive so space really isn't an issue. Over all very pleased"," July 23, 2021",5.0
,"This is an excellent computer for the money. It starts up much faster than I expected. The colors look good and the graphics look excellent. It also has good filtering for blue light. This is helpful if you do a lot of late night studying/working. Battery life seems excellent.

The size makes this perfect for travel or carrying around. It is light, but reasonably sturdy. I am using it as a student, so it is perfect for that and offers a lot more power and convenience than more expensive laptops that I have had. For example, I like it better than the Microsoft Surface I previously had because this has an SD card reader whereas the Surface does not. This one also has a built-in lens cover over the camera to keep the weirdos and criminals from watching you. With other computers, I've had to use tape or buy a lens cover.

An excellent laptop for daily use,"This review is for the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 (14ALC6), featuring an AMD Ryzen 5500U processor with integrated Radeon 7 graphics and a 14"" display. I used this as my personal computer for roughly three weeks, and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed at just how capable and well-rounded this computer is. At less than $500, this IdeaPad 3 is technically a budget laptop, but it is very well equipped and offers incredible performance. In several benchmarks and real-world tests, I was shocked to discover that the 15W Ryzen 5500U matched and sometimes beat my relatively high-end work laptop with a 45W Intel i7-9750H processor that cost more than $2000 at the end of 2019. Feature-wise, the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 offers an attractive thin and light chassis with slim bezels around a 1080p IPS display, and several features such as the webcam with privacy shutter, integrated fingerprint reader, support for Wi-Fi 6, and backlit keyboard were previously exclusive to more premium models. Overall, this laptop is a phenomenal value for everyday computing.

In my opinion, the IdeaPad 3's most significant flaw is its USB-C port implementation. Unfortunately, it only has a single USB-C port that's limited to data transfers only. USB Power Delivery and video out functions are not supported. This is very disappointing even for a budget laptop since USB-C PD chargers and multi-function adapters are already widely available, and Google even recommends this functionality for cheap Chromebooks. You are essentially forced to use the proprietary 65W power adapter, which in fairness is pretty compact and lightweight but the power prongs aren't foldable.

With respect to gaming performance, the 5500U's integrated Radeon 7 graphics is essentially equivalent to a low-end discrete graphics card such as the nVidia GeForce MX250. The IdeaPad 3 is no gaming powerhouse but it is more than capable of smoothly running less demanding modern titles such as Streets of Rage 4, Genshin Impact (l1080p low preset), Lonely Mountains: Downhill, etc. It can also run some older AAA games like GTA 5 and Metro 2033 at 1080p with low presets. Just for fun, I tried playing Tell Me Why which lists a GTX 1050 as a ""minimum requirement"" and the game ran fine at ~30 FPS at 1080p using medium settings.

Something to pay attention to, especially if you're not going to be gaming, is that while the IdeaPad 3 comes with a respectable 8GB of RAM, the default UMA frame buffer size is set to 2GB which means that 2GB is dedicated to the GPU and only 6GB is available to Windows and the rest of your applications. AMD (and Lenovo) do this for compatibility reasons because some games will check the frame buffer size and might throw a warning or otherwise exhibit undesirable behavior such as low-resolution/missing textures if it's too small. In reality, in the case of the 5500U and Radeon 7 graphics, the frame buffer size doesn't matter because the CPU and GPU share a common pool of dynamically allocated memory. If graphics assets exceed the defined UMA frame buffer size, they will automatically consume system memory and the game will continue running with no performance impact. Therefore, I'd recommend setting the UMA frame buffer size to 1GB or less to maximize the size of the shared memory pool.

Regarding the software side of things, there are the usual pre-installed programs such as Microsoft 365 and McAfee, a handful of Lenovo-specific utilities such as Vantage, and few surprises such as Amazon's Alexa and Lenovo Voice. For this review, I played with both virtual assistants and found that Alexa worked beautifully; I wish Windows 10 had such a capable and easy-to-use voice assistant built-in. Lenovo Voice, unfortunately, was a total disaster. Not only did it regularly fail to comprehend what I was saying, but the headline functionality such as real-time translation and voice-to-text is only available if you pay. Another unwelcome surprise was that Lenovo Vantage behaved quite differently compared to the version on my ThinkPad. One of the features that I cherish on Lenovo computers is the ability to set battery charging thresholds. In the long run, it's not good for lithium-ion batteries to be kept at 100% state of charge for days-on-end, so this setting allows you to keep the battery partially charged. On my ThinkPad, I can choose between 45% to 100%, but on the IdeaPad 3, the battery conservation mode's threshold is fixed at 55-60% and can't be changed. I prefer keeping my laptop between 70-80% state of charge as a compromise between extending the battery's lifespan and still getting a good amount of time away from the charger.

At the end of the day, I really like this laptop. The performance, battery life, and features such as IPS display and fingerprint reader are beyond my expectations. The keyboard, touchpad, and speakers are pretty typical of the class and the only real disappointment is the USB-C port's implementation. Strongly recommended.

Notes:
1) The IdeaPad 3's Q-Control allows you to configure the AMD Ryzen 5500U's TDP which basically affects CPU/GPU performance and battery life. The default setting is Intelligent Cooling which limits sustained TDP at 15W but allows for brief spikes up to ~22W. The Extreme Performance mode allows for sustained ~28W TDP at the expense of higher operating temperature and fan noise.
2) To get into BIOS, you first need to boot into Windows 10 and then from the advanced startup options, choose UEFI firmware settings.
3) The Ryzen 5000 family is a bit complicated because some chips have the Zen 2 core and others have Zen 3. The IdeaPad 3's various configurations are all based on Zen 2. Some people might be tempted to compare the 5500U with the previous 4600U since they have the same core count and clock speed, but the 5500U has a faster GPU (one additional core and higher clocks).
4) While this IdeaPad 3 has a 1080p IPS panel with a minimum of 45% NTSC color gamut and 300 nits brightness, other specifications such as contrast ratio and response times are not published. That's because Lenovo's support site says that there are 6 equivalent LCD panels that can be used with this model.
5) This computer is Windows 11 Ready.
6) ** Update 8/16/2021 ** I was visiting a friend and discovered that the Realtek WiFi card couldn't connect to a Ubiquiti access point. I had to go to device manager and disable 5Ghz wireless mode to get it to work."," August 8, 2021",5.0

Overall a solid budget laptop,"To start: I am beyond impressed with the value this laptop offers for less than $500. I can't find anything else on the market that even comes close. That said, it is important to understand who this laptop is really for and what it can do.

First of all, despite what Lenovo advertises, this is *not* a gaming laptop. It can play games to a degree (more on this later), but this is not something to get ""elite gaming performance"" on. What this is is an amazing productivity laptop for most everyone who wants to do 'normal' laptop stuff (office tasks, Netflix, etc), with a bit more on top (light gaming, productivity work, coding, etc). The processor/graphics in this laptop is usually in models that are, $100-$300 more, so you are getting relatively good performance with cut corners elsewhere.

So, here are my thoughts on the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of this laptop. Note that for all of my testing all I did was fully upgrade windows/drivers and uninstall Mcafee. I didn't do a clean install or anything 'fancy' like that, as I'm guessing the average user who buys this laptop won't either.

Good:
* AMD Ryzen 5 5500U - This is a very solid CPU thin and light laptops (notebookcheck.net has a good overview of what you can expect from it). In Lenovo's 'balanced' performance mode I got the attached cinebench 23 scores (6272 multithread, 1175 singlethread), where in 'performance' mode my multi-thread score went up to 6832 at the expense of more fan noise. For a sub-$500 machine this is great!
* Graphics performance - youtube Ryzen 5 5500U performance to see what to expect; generally you can play new games on the lowest settings and get smooth performance. Do note that the 8 GB of RAM on this machine will be a bottleneck so expect lower results than what you might see online. Older games should run fine. Notebookcheck also has good benchmarks for the Radeon RX Vega 7. Do note that this is an integrated graphics chip. Graphics chips can either be 'integrated' or 'discrete'; integrated chips are built into the CPU die and are much lower power, whereas 'discrete' chips are separate and much higher power. To do 'serious' gaming or content creation that requires graphics horsepower you're going to generally need a discrete chip. That said, the Vega 7 does get pretty impressive performance for an integrated chip, especially at this price point.
* Battery Life - With 50% screen brightness I am getting around 8 hours of battery life. Again, at this price point that is awesome!
* 1080p Screen - Again, for a sub-$500 laptop this is a selling point!
* 8 GB RAM, 256 GB NVME SSD - For sub-$500 this is great; compare it to a surface laptop for example and watch the price explode on the surface to match these specs.
* Nice Bonus Features - The laptop has keyboard backlighting (2 brightness levels: dim and bright, and only white colored), a physical slider to cover the webcam, and a biometric fingerprint scanner built into the power button which works really well. I would've expected none of this for less than $500, so this is all great.

The Bad:
* Soldered RAM: This laptop comes with 4 GB of RAM soldered to the board, with a user-replaceable 4 GB stick. This is unfortunate because, while you technically can upgrade to a larger RAM stick, you lose the benefits of dual channel performance for the extra memory. This is the biggest failing of the laptop, in my opinion; non-soldered RAM so a user could upgrade to 16 GB dual channel would have been great.
* Screen: The color gamut of the screen leaves a lot to be desired; after calibration (and it definitely needed calibration) I was getting 65% sRGB, 46% NTSC, 49% AdobeRGB, 48% P3. While fine for things this is definitely not going to hold up next to any nice laptop screen or external monitor. That said ... this laptop is less than $500 so I can't really complain too much. At this price point this is exactly what I would expect. Brightness and black levels seem to be fine, and there is little to no screen bleed, which is great.

The Ugly:
* The top of the laptop (which is a very nice brushed metal looking finish) scratches incredibly easily. I had it top down on a clean wood table and somehow it got some deep scratches on it. I have no idea how, I can't find anything that would have scratched it ... but there it is. Its just cosmetic, but its annoying.
* The bottom panel is *very* difficult to get off. There are 9 screws to take out (I almost stripped one of them it was on so tightly), and then the bottom panel is still attached with internal plastic hooks or something. I couldn't get it off with a guitar pick or credit card - per youtube videos it can be done, but I don't think my plastic was hard enough. I've never had a bottom laptop panel be this difficult.
* The power brick (picture attached) is annoying, as the outlet prong is right on it. This means it takes up a lot of space on the wall or wherever you have it plugged in. It also doesn't have a ground pin, which I don't like.
* The keyboard isn't quite as nice as older thinkpad models (less travel) and there are no dedicated left/right buttons anymore ... which I think is a big loss.

Overall:
The overall take away for me is that this laptop is just incredible from a value perspective. It competes with laptops that are a few hundred dollars more in terms of its performance. There are definite cut corners (most notably the soldered RAM and the screen), however I don't think there is anything remotely in this laptop's league in the sub-$500 price bracket. Maybe if you find something on sale for a large discount, but even then its very hard to beat this price - I personally haven't seen anything and I've spent some time looking.

I do think Lenovo's advertising is a bit deceptive; while this can certainly do some gaming its not remotely an 'elite' gaming machine. However, if you come into this with the proper expectations you will be very pleasantly surprised at the performance available at this price-point.

If you're in the market for a laptop at this price point I don't think there is any real competition right now unless you need a specialty form factor or something - this is the laptop to buy, as far as I can tell. Great job Lenovo!"," July 14, 2021",5.0

Great for kids or travel,"My 14 inch IdeaPad 3 is a great laptop when it is working. Unfortunately, due to a bug in the hardware, it either crashes or runs at a snail's pace at least 10 percent of the time, consuming 100 percent of the disk storage, even when no programs are running. I am forced to recboot the computer, which usually (but not always) solves the problem. Lenovo support is not helpful.

Works well only some of the time,"Finding a 5th generation Ryzen in a laptop, let alone a mid-priced consumer grade laptop has been a tremendous challenge lately, but once again, the fellas at Lenovo have done it. Bundle up the newest generation hexa-core AMD processor that otherwise can only be found in laptop configurations ~$200 more expensive with an actually usable amount (256GB) of fast NVME SSD space, enough Vega 7 graphical prowess to chug through your older games and MOBAs and the ability to downrate TDP to 15W so that it runs for 9-10 hours of medium use on a sizable 45Wh battery (can also uprate TDP to 35W so it can boost to 4GHz for processor heavy tasks!), and you have some incredible value. Ram is fast too: 3200MHz out of the box in a dual channel arrangement! Shame you only get a stingy 8GB, but its good enough for most tasks. Wifi is a 2x2 antenna layout for excellent coverage and impressive download speeds. The 1080p IPS is a very welcome addition given all the crappy 1366x768s in this price range, but its nothing to write home about in terms of colors or brightness. Keyboard is inoffensive, with decent travel and slightly raised chiclets for added tactility (backlit too!). Surprisingly impressive mic suite for a laptop, with customizable pickup patterns (forward, forward-wide/cardioid ish, and full 360), but the mics themselves are not very good. Tiny little fingerprint sensor in the power button for all your fingerprint needs.

For the less-good: Ideapads are inherently less upgradable, but Lenovo has decided to exchange a 2.5 inch hard drive bay for an extra cell in their battery unit, so no easy fix for the smaller NVME drive short of a replacement and a full reinstall (or get an external HDD). Only 1 slot of the ram is replaceable, with the rest of it neatly soldered onto the motherboard (Lenovo, please stop doing this), and 8GB goes FAST with 2GB already preallocated for the graphics unit. This also means that any additional Ram upgrades you install will only run 8GB in dual channel, with the remainder falling back into single channel. Build quality is workable, but the chassis does feel like a $400-500 consumer laptop (read: cheap and plastic. The blue finish is quite nice though). Don't try to hammer any nails with this. The speakers are terrible and tinny, but Dolby Atmos fills in the gaps quite well if you are forced to listen to them. Camera is solidly mediocre, but has a little privacy slider so the feds don't see you petting your cat for hours on end.

Overall: You get what you pay for, and also much, much more in terms of internals. This is the cheapest way to get a very strong processor into a respectable form factor, with the versatility to perform a plethora of productivity and entertainment tasks in a variety of situations. Light and portable at the risk of feeling a tad cheap, but makes up for it with solid internals (despite some minor corner cutting in this department that honestly does not impact common use cases). Get it, slap in a tad more Ram so your stats software doesn't crash and a cheap external HDD, and chug away!"," September 16, 2021",5.0
,"I wanted a decently-equipped, lightweight 14-inch laptop to use on the go without breaking the bank and this hit all the notes. I wound up dual-booting it with Pop OS and setup worked well and the 256 GB drive left me more than enough space for a dual install. The memory is partially soldered to the motherboard while another 4 GB stick is replaceable so I swapped that out with an 8 GB one to bump up the system memory to 12 GBs. I believe it can handle up to 20 GB(16 GB stick + 4 GB), and noticed that memory usage in Windows 10 was more stable with the upgrade. That said, 8 GBs is likely more than enough.

You can also replace the SSD with another NVMe, though make sure you get the right form factor - it's a 2242 (the smallest one) in case you're looking. But it's quite easy to replace it if you want.

I've not tried to stress-test the CPU but I've been able to run a docker image + multiple Chrome tabs + VS code without the fan even kicking on, and my guess is it could handle light-ish gaming as well. For basic office/web/home usage it'll be more than enough. Again, calibrate your expectations but this isn't a bargain-basement device.

Screen is solid - it's FHD but at 14 inches you don't see much pixelation and the IPS limits washout from different angles. Brightness is solid as well, though it's certainly not the brightest you'll see. But again, it's good for the price point. And the backlit keyboard has multiple brightness settings depending on the environment.

My one big complain is the USB-C port is for data transfer only - no power in or video out. The device has a full-size HDMI port so it's not a deal-breaker but I really would have liked to not have to carry around a device-specific charger. Not a deal breaker but that feels like an unnecessary corner to cut.

Still, a good value thus far and I'm happy with how this Ideapad will scale with my needs."," October 5, 2021",5.0
Not enough for the price,"edit, I've had this Ideapad 3 14"" for just over a month now and am loving it. While it does not boot faster then my old laptop, when I run code like CURA 3D printing slicer code for example, that runs in 45 seconds where on my old laptop it took 90 seconds. The smaller and lighter footprint/weight of the laptop is significant, and much handier. I have no problem with the display, looks great. It's not a fancy laptop, I think of it as a sleeper, modest looking with blazing performance.

I replaced a $700 Lenovo Flex 5 14"" so I'll compare to that. The ideapad 3 14 case is plain smooth plastic, but feels sturdier. This ideapad cpu spec is more than 2X faster, and I do see the performance improvement. I never really use the touch screen, so I was happy to give that up. I expect this standard hinge laptop to hold up better than that Flex 360 hinge that broke. What is really nice: This new laptop is 0.8 pounds lighter, about a quarter inch less wide, and an inch less deep with the same size screen, a surprising significant improvement.

good laptop with not so good screen,"I needed a laptop to do some remote work but didn't want to spend much money. For the money, this is a decent PC. It has a current Intel i3 processor which is fine for apps that aren't heavy on the processor. Boots up quickly. Gamers should look elsewhere but fine for surfing, email and watching videos. A $20 investment in a 8Gb memory stick is a good idea. Ditch the Window S operating system right away. It's easy to convert it to Windows Home for free which will open it up to apps outside the clutches of the the Windows Store. Screen has a limited field of view but OK when tilted properly.

Good cheap laptop,"This laptop is genuinely pretty good. You probably won't find a faster laptop for this price point. Most laptops around this price tag use a few year-olds processor, while these uses a true 2022 processor. Intel's 12th gen i3 here is so much powerful than the competition. 3x faster than my old laptop that I had to replace, that was nearly the same price as this 3 years ago.

You definitely should spend the 40$ to add an 8GB stick of RAM to the laptop to completely unlock this beast.

The only complaint is the screen. It's simply not good. Not only is it a slightly above 720P screen (pretty low for 2022), the viewing angles and colors are also atrocious. You could remediate this by using a proper screen (usb c!), however that defeats the purpose of a laptop. But it's very much good enough, just wish it was better."," October 17, 2022",5.0
,"Battery life isn't even close to the 10 hours that they claim, it's around 4-5 hours of battery life. The speakers are on the bottom, so if you have it sitting on your lap or anything that isn't a flat surface then the sound gets muffled. On top of that the speaker output volume isn't very loud. If you're in a room with any other noise in it then you're going to have difficulty hearing anything, even with the volume turned all the way up. The only other negative is when I opened it the rubber bumper that's supposed to be on the bottom to keep it from sliding around had come off and was stuck to the back of the laptop, I peeled it off and stuck it back where it's supposed to be, but the sticky stuff they use isn't strong enough and it starts to peel off sometimes.

Not worth it,"This is a conundrum of a laptop. On one hand, it’s got some great features such as the i3 processor, a fast NVMe SSD, and it’s quite snappy when I’m using it. I’m not getting any delayed actions or anything like that but it is performing like a much more costly laptop in a lot of ways. With that being said, the value is alright but it’s a surprising that you can’t charge it via the USB-C port (it’s data only) and the fact it comes with only 4 GB of RAM but I upgraded it by adding a stick of 16 GB of RAM. I didn’t think this would work as the listing indicated it’s upgradable to 12 GB (by adding an 8 GB stick) but I got a 16 GB kit but I had no idea it was one and not two 8 GB sticks. Nonetheless, even though the stats say it only accepts up to 12 GB, I installed the 16 GB stick anyway just to test it and when I went to the “About” part in the Windows 11 settings, it shows it has 20 GB of RAM (with just over 19 GB being usable). The RAM that I got isn’t special or anything but it is DDR4. That was an awesome surprise and I’m betting that it likely changed it to dual channel and it’s probably making it feel faster. I’m way more than pleasantly surprised but do wish they had added another hard drive slot to upgrade (it can be upgraded to 512 GB but you’ll likely need to clone the original and that is a task sometimes (other times it’s super easy and flawless but it just depends).

Installing the RAM:

Use a small Philips bit screwdriver and unscrew all the screws from the back panel. Make note of where the screws come out of because the ones in the front are short, the sides are longer and the corners are the longest. Once you’ve got the screws out, take a very small flat head and pop (gently) the back off. Once off, you’ll see the slot to pop the stick of RAM into. Make sure it boots up and then screw it back in when you’re sure.

Pros:

Fast setup
Not a lot of bloatware
Full sized SD reader/writer
HDMI out port
USB-C port (data only, not charging)
Way faster than I expected
Charges fast
Webcam & physical cover
Windows 11 (some like it, some don’t)
Fast i3 processor
Upgradable RAM
Fingerprint reader works well
Surprisingly good speakers (and they can get fairly loud)

Cons:

S-mode won’t allow Chrome to be installed (simple to remove S-mode and it can’t be put back on after you remove it)

USB-C isn’t used for charging

One nvme slot (with 128 GB drive it comes with)

Power cable could be longer (not super short but I did notice a slight difference from my older one)

Overall:

If you’re looking for a laptop to do a lot of things that are more basic (not gaming or video editing or crunching huge spreadsheets with macros and SQL), this is surprising me in a good way and I think it should fit a lot of uses. It’s way faster than I am used to seeing with an “entry level” laptop. The battery life won’t blow the doors off anything else but it’s acceptable. It does charge very quickly. The screen resolution could be better but it’s a budget offering. The lack of another nvme slot for a second hard drive is interesting but it can be overcome with external drives or cloning the one that comes with it. This is great for a college student or someone who wants a fairly quick budget laptop."," December 24, 2022",4.0
,"If you are looking for a basic laptop at a fair price, this may be it. If you are a gamer or a power user, you already know this is not the one for you. I am not an expert or a student of all the specs, but I know enough to know what to look out for in selecting a ""typical user laptop"".

I will highlight what I think a novice user comparing this laptop to others may need to look out for:

PROS:
1. Upgradeable RAM. This one comes with 4GB DDR4 (which is great for most users), but is upgradeable to 12GB according to Lenovo.
2. Brand name. Lenovo is a known brand and has a good reputation and customer service.
3. Intel Core i3 processor. Better performance than lower priced Celeron model. I prefer Intel to other brands, and i3 is certainly acceptable for typical users.
4. USB-C port. Many lower priced laptops do not have one. Important because this allows connection with many of the newer accessories available, as USB-C is faster and becoming the standard in USB accessories.
5. HDMI out port. Many lower priced laptops do not have one, this one does, which allows you to connect to your TV for viewing or mirroring.
6. Comes with a 128GB SSD. This is relatively small, but unless you plan to store locally instead of the cloud, this is more than enough for most users. Of course it is upgradeable to a larger hard drive at any time.
7. Preloaded with Windows 11 and the Office Suite, and thankfully not too much other garbage you don't need.

CONS:
1. I like a backlit keyboard. This one does not have that.
2. I may not have it set correctly, but out of the box the maximum I am getting is a screen resolution of 1366x768. This is adequate, but not exactly full HD.
3. Like most other recent laptops, the CD/DVD drive is a thing of the past. You would need to buy an external CD/DVD drive if you need one.
4. NOT A BAD THING, but note, this is NOT a touchscreen.

As far as the rest of the performance and/or bells and whistles, it is nice and light, quite thin and stylish. It has a fingerprint reader built onto the power button (which is cool) and it boots up quickly from sleep mode, and processes without lag. The battery life is comparable to any other laptop you'd buy and has plenty of charge for road trips.

Bottom line: If you are a websurfer and emailer or want to Skype with your family or perhaps prepare the occasional spreadsheet, you're not going to be disappointed in this laptop."," August 28, 2022",4.0
Publicidad engañosa,"I've had this laptop for about five weeks and I wanted to really play with it before I gave a review. I like to review things for at least a couple of weeks to make sure I give it accurate review. I do that because sometimes when you take things out of the box they immediately work great but then things can start happening so here's what I have.
I will start off with, if you are looking for a high-powered, gaming, video editing laptop, this is not the one you want. This laptop is good for students, normal end-users, and things of that sort. It's pretty basic to its core and does all the things you need if you are searching the web, watching a Netflix movie, or other videos on YouTube etc. It also comes with an HDMI port for adding an external monitor.
The one thing that stood out to me was how fast this laptop charges. The battery is very good on this laptop. I like the fingerprint scanner, as it almost reminds me of a MacBook for signing in and verifying purchases and things like that. I also like that you can upgrade many things on this laptop if you need to. That is a huge plus because if you want to add power to this laptop, you can upgrade the memory and other things. The setup is super easy and the laptop walks you through everything step by step.
This laptop is also very stylish, sleek, and slim. It's doesn't weigh much at all and is very easy to travel with.

I like Lenovo, and they make good products, but I did find similar laptops online slightly cheaper than what this one is running for. I really didn't find any cons to talk about because of course, I didn't get this laptop as if I was trying to compare it to some $4000 gaming PC of MacBook. Again, this is a great laptop for students, or your everyday user just browsing the web, watching movies, etc.
Giving this a 4 Star rating!"," September 19, 2022",4.0
,"Honestly, I'm impressed with this thing. I just wanted something I can type on, and this fits the bill well! It's compact and easy to type on.

Given this is an i3, I wasn't expecting much. As far as processing power, it definitely lacks. You won't be playing AAA games on this device. Still, it installs Steam and the Xbox apps (after disabling Windows S mode), and runs via streaming at a decent pace over WiFi, so if you have a gaming rig or Xbox Game Pass to stream from (or any other cloud/streaming game service), this works great! I was getting a decent framerate and little lag while playing online games via the cloud without issues.

Really, though, I wanted this to type up documents on. It has a chicklet keyboard with low-profile key caps. The keys all have rounded bottoms, which is a bit strange, but doesn't take away with how it feels. I can type relatively fast on this thing, even though it's a membrane keyboard (I'm assuming; I haven't taken a cap off to find out for sure, and that's just what it feels like. No N-Key rollover or anything fancy, but it hasn't lost a keypress, and it feels okay, so no big loss. Besides, with the USB ports available, I can hook up any of my mechanical keyboards anyway.

Other than HDMI, I haven't tested all of the I/O on this yet. It has an SD slot, 2 USB-A and 1 USB-C ports, headphone jack, and a barrel jack for power. Would have liked to see USB-C power, but not needed.

The battery life on this is incredible so far. I've been using it for text, typing, game streaming, and web surfing, and after several hours, I still have 61% battery life left!

Surprisingly, this is pretty fast for what it is! It's using an M.2 NVME drive for it's 128GB storage, and it reacts well on this machine! Boot times are minuscule, and login via fingerprint is immediate. It actually surprises me how well this thing moves!

Edit: after opening the device, it is definitely upgradeable. What I find strange is it has 4GB of RAM installed, yet the one memory port on the motherboard isn’t populated. Eventually, I’ll try to install more RAM, but I don’t have a need for it yet. Also, the M.2 slot uses the shorter drives (can’t remember which kind it’s called; 2242, maybe?), but appears to have space for a full 2280 (although I don’t have a spare to try at the moment). Still, the fact that it’s upgradeable is impressive.

This is a great business or typing/text/surfing laptop! If you want something portable to run for hours, this is a great buy! So far, I have no complaints, and I highly recommend this device!"," August 18, 2022",5.0

A huge jump in processor performance from the last generation. The screen is ok, not the greatest for wide angles, but clear and vivid colors and little to no glare.
The biometric login is great for security and can be used for login to software that supports biometrics as well!
The laptop allows for only one additional stick of ram max 8gb to be added to the 4gb of soldered down ram included. So keep in mind your upgrade would be limited to 12gb max.

,"This Lenovo - 2022 - IdeaPad 1i - Browse Laptop Computer - Intel Core i3 12th Gen - 14.0"" HD is an affordable, lightweight laptop computer that works best for web browsing, word processing, or working on the go.

I've never owned a Lenovo laptop before, but I've heard good things about them, I tend to own or build computers/laptops with the highest specs I can afford that will last me a long time which regarding laptops have led me to gaming laptops like the Asus Strix Scar 17 SE I purchased earlier this year. This laptop doesn't really compete with the Strix since this is a small, lightweight laptop designed for the casual user, and the Strix is certainly not small or lightweight and designed for power users or gamers.

I was surprised by how well this little Lenovo laptop performed, I was expecting it to perform like a low-end Chromebook or perhaps maybe even worse because of how heavy Windows 11 is on low end spec. But when I received it and booted it up for the first time, I was surprised at how snappy the performance was. The screen is small at only 14 in, and is not a touchscreen display, but because of the size the HD display looks pretty good and is very bright.

One thing that is not very bright is the lack of backlighting on the keyboard, I understand that was cut to save costs to reach the price point, but I would've liked to have seen that kept on because of how useful it is to have backlit keys.

I'd like to note that although this laptop comes with Windows 11 in S mode, which is Windows ""walled off garden"" approach to operating systems meaning you can only install verified software through the Windows Store, which while the selection has gotten better, is still extremely limited. However, you can easily switch off S mode and use Windows 11 normally, so I don't see this as a major issue. Just know that all the threats of downloading unknown software from places you find on the internet can lead to accidentally installing malware, spyware, or ransomware so definitely be sure you know what you're downloading before you install it, especially with how prevalent Phishing has become lately with scammers setting up sites that look close enough to authentic to fool most people. Always double check the web address and make sure that the website you're downloading from is the legit source and not some alphabet soup web address that is trying to mislead you.

I was exceptionally impressed at the build quality of this IdeaPad 1i, it certainly doesn't feel like an affordable laptop, and I especially liked the fact that the case isn't a fingerprint magnet that is impossible to clean like the Strix is. I was so impressed with this laptop that when my brother called me earlier this week asking me if I could help him find a good Windows laptop for my nephew that I ordered the 2022 Lenovo IdeaPad 3i which is a step up from this laptop in size and specs and has been an excellent laptop for my nephew's schoolwork.

Overall, this is one of the best and most affordable entry level Windows 11 laptops available today. Performance is surprisingly zippy, and the lightweight and smaller size make it easy to take along with you wherever you go. Battery life is also exceptional and recharging it can be done surprisingly quickly. As a power user who usually wouldn't be caught dead using a laptop like this, I have found myself taking this Lenovo with me more often when I'm mobile instead of hauling the much larger and heavier Strix in my backpack with me. I appreciate that I can take this without the charger and not have to worry about battery life or reduced performance if I did the same with the Strix. I will mention that I would've really liked it if the keyboard were backlit on this laptop, I know it was likely cut for cost saving measures, but I would rather pay a bit more for the backlit keyboard than to not have it at all. 5/5 stars."," September 2, 2022",5.0
A great value laptop!,"I have another model from Lenovo that is a higher tier with better specs, but they are both built quite well and feel nice to use.

," Usually when you get a laptop for this price you expect the laptop to be a little on the slower side especially since most laptops today have 4 GB of memory. This laptop comes with 4 GB of memory soldered in and the laptop will accept another 8 GB of memory which is on order.

This is surprisingly fast for only 4 gigs of memory. I had no issues with downloads, apps watching movies or downloading about 50gb of data from my OneDrive. The laptop boots up in about 15 seconds.
The i3-1215U with four efficiency cores and two high performance cores that are hyperthreaded give this computer a lot more power than you would expect I was thoroughly blown away with how fast it really is for the most part.

a couple things that I do recommend because this comes with windows S is to change it over to windows home from the store when you get it so you can install apps that are not located on the store itself but that is really a personal preference since I work in IT.

one of the other things I also did was add another eight gigs of ram to this after some playing around with it I had no issue addressing the additional 8 Rams taking out up to 12 total and after that it is extremely fast for what it is battery life is thoroughly outstanding and I would guess from my usage a full day of battery is very doable with this laptop.

the only true con to this laptop that I can think of is the quality of the screen I do wish it was a 1080P screen and have a little bit better quality but for the price you really can't beat it considering how fast it is. overall this would be a terrific laptop for anyone for schoolwork browsing the web word processing and some light games.

overall this is a great budget laptop that I believe most people would be pretty happy with I think Lenovo did a very good job overall for the quality, lightness, and power of the laptop"," September 1, 2022",5.0
Impressed,"Having had several Lenovo products over the years I always felt good about owing them. My last one was a laptop I got a couple years ago and really liked it but left it at my daughters house last visit and never retrieved it. I looked at this Lenovo - 2022 - IdeaPad 1i to replace it as it is compatible with Windows 11 too. In the upper right is an easy touch button to turn it on with an extremely fast boot up to the home page under ten seconds. Keyboard has a nice touch along with the pad with just the right amount of sensitivity, for me some pads are just too sensitive. On one side it has a USB-C and the normal USB-A then on the other it has another USB-A with a full size SD card reader instead of the micro ones allowing me to put my camera card in directly. I was pleased with the speed of the new 12th generation I3 and good for browsing and more. This will be the one I take when traveling but also the primary one for browsing while sitting back in my recliner, it's great for that and with the 14 inch screen over the other that was 12 1/2 inch its easier on the eyes.

,"The build quality is quite nice for a entry level laptop in the 400 dollar range. Its not too heavy, bezels are not too large, and the keyboard/trackpad feel good. The fingerprint sensor is also a nice touch. Obviously, some compromises had to be made to meet this low price. The display is a subpar 1366x768 TN panel that has pretty washed out colors. I estimate the max brightness to be around 250 nits, which is acceptable for indoor use but not good in the sun. Having only 4GB ram is not enough in 2022, but luckily you can add a stick and get 12gb total RAM. It appears the 128gb M.2 SSD is also user replaceable.

La computadora sirve al 100%,"I bought this computer for the tablet and pen extras. When I got it, the computer is excellent but the pen port was damaged so it cannot charge and will not work. I tried to contact the seller but almost a week later have not heard anything. The computer also arrived almost a week later than expected. I love the yoga pro computer when it functions but I really should’ve just ordered off of eBay.

I was refunded through amazon, never got a reply from the seller. I reordered through Amazon (because the money was an amazon credit and I really want this model and could not afford to purchase it elsewhere) and again, the pen doesn't work. Still no reply from the seller and this is round two. I'm mad. The computer itself is fine (the second one had debris of some sort on the keyboard that I had to clean off). I'm just so upset because I cannot get the pen to work. I've uninstalled and reinstalled drivers, been through every fix I can find. It's really infuriating.

,"It came with Win-10 Student, spent all evening updating, Left it on and plugged in overnight Tuesday to catch the Windows updates. The next morning it was a brick, would not boot up.

Opened up the base and found a 64 gig memory card soldered on and four gig of ram soldered on so I could not even replace the memory card. If I wanted this kind of junk I would have ordered a MAC.

Not impressed at all.,"This laptop is an excellent value for the money. I shopped for weeks for a replacement because I had a limited budget but still needed something that was reliable and durable. Thus far this laptop has proven to be both reliable and durable. It meets my needs just fine which is mostly performing home banking and productivity software from my home as well as watching the occasional YouTube video. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this laptop performed.I did the CPU upgrade to Quad Core N5000 for $19 and seller offered very reasonable price for memory and hard drive upgrade as well. Unfortunately I did the SSD and RAM upgrade by myself by spending a lot more money and a whole day trying to figure out how to clone the system. I could have saved both money and time by just letting seller do it. Now the laptop is faster than my old $1000 i7 dell. Startup takes less than 10 sec.

,Mixed review. Set it up and the next time I turned it on the keyboard didn't work. Was on hold for hours with Lenovo. Even tried chat (from another computer) They disconnected and hung up. Was on hold for hours. Don't expect support from Lenovo. Went on google and found out how to do a factory reset. Did that and keyboard worked. Next time I logged on it said windows didn't load properly. I had to do another factory reset and it worked again. I have turned it off and on a few more times because I was ready to return it and wanted to see if I would get that error again. Now it seems to work great. It is fast and fine for my basic needs.

An hour on the phone with Lenovo customer service (many solution suggestions) resulted in nothing. An email suggestion from Apricot and a YouTube search gave me the courage to ""re-set"" the PC. After about an hour it was operating fine. Two notes, 1) the PC was fine the problem was with the Windows update and driver, 2) Apricot was willing to exchange the PC if I could not get it working.

,"The Acer Swift 3 OLED Intel Evo Thin & Light Laptop, as the name suggests, is designed for those who desire power and portability in their computing experience. It offers plenty of features that make it an attractive option in a saturated market of portable laptops.

The first thing you'll notice is the Swift 3's sleek design. With its thin profile and lightweight construction, it is an excellent companion for those who travel or commute frequently. The aluminium chassis not only contributes to its lightweight nature but also gives it a premium feel that stands out from the plastic designs of similar models.

The most significant selling point of this laptop is undoubtedly its OLED display. The colors are vivid, and the contrast is deep - bringing visuals to life whether you're working, watching a movie, or browsing. The 13.5-inch, 2256 x 1504 display offers sharp and detailed visuals, making long hours of screen time a more enjoyable experience.

Performance-wise, the Intel Evo certification ensures quick response, speedy load times, and sufficient power for most everyday tasks and some light gaming. The laptop boots up swiftly and handles multitasking well, thanks to its 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM. The 512GB SSD also ensures that you have plenty of fast, responsive storage for your files and programs.

Battery life is also a strong suit for this laptop. I found that under regular use - web browsing, streaming video, and using productivity apps - the battery easily lasts through a full workday.

However, it's not without its shortcomings. The main drawback is the 8GB of RAM, which, while sufficient for everyday tasks, may not be enough for more intensive applications or heavy multitasking. It's not a deal-breaker, but for power users, this could be a point of contention.

Additionally, the laptop tends to run a bit hot under heavy load. While it never reached a point of concern during my testing, it's something to keep in mind if you plan on doing resource-intensive tasks.

In conclusion, the Acer Swift 3 OLED Intel Evo Thin & Light Laptop offers a lot of value for its price point, boasting a stunning OLED display and robust performance in a sleek, portable package. While it may not satisfy the needs of power users, it's an excellent option for those who prioritize portability and display quality. It's not a perfect laptop, but for what it offers, it's certainly worth considering."," June 1, 2023",4.0

,"It runs something called Windows 10 S, which is for computers that do not have enough memory and computing power to run real Windows 10. The computer has an option to run real Windows 10, but if you try to turn it on you receive a warning that you should not do so. Once you convert to real Windows 10 you cannot go back to Windows 10 S.

That means you can only run a subset of in some cases crippled Windows 10 apps. For instance, if you want to install Chrome or Firefox you cannot without blowing away Windows 10 S and possibly breaking whatever is barely working.

Even when running Windows 10 S it is slow. Everything takes forever to load.

I am keeping the computer however. It minimally does what I needed. I wanted it to be able to play DVDs using an external drive, and I wanted it to be able to display the Amazon Music Player app properly. It does both those things. But any illusion I had that I could use this computer to program in computer languages using a visual GUI (eg Racket or Rust or even Python) is gone.

Also be aware that this computer is only sold on Amazon by third parties. For some reason Amazon will not sell this computer directly. The price may be cheaper elsewhere.

I would never recommend this computer for general purpose use. Someone said that he gave this computer to a student to use as the student's main computer. It is hard to believe that the student can use it without recurring problems. The student should focus on his schoolwork, not on figuring out workarounds to get this computer to do what it is supposed to.

Advertising this computer as running Windows 10 borders on false advertising. It only runs a crippled version of Windows 10, not real Windows 10.

One can get a Chromebook for the same price, and unless one wants to play a DVD the Chromebook will do everything this computer does and do it much better and faster, without any of the annoyances this computer brings with it. Good thing this computer is cheap, otherwise I would feel cheated."," May 2, 2020",5.0

Slower than a sloth.,"I would not recommend purchasing this product. I mistakenly ordered before thoroughly reading reviews.

I received the laptop and I went through the setup. I used a pin as the option to access the computer for son. He went to enter the very simple pin and was locked out. I then attempted to enter the pin and noticed for every one number/letter I pressed, two would actually show up on the screen.

I pressed “show password” and all I know if every single letter and number was attached to a letter or number next to it.

Ex: If you select “a” it shows as “QA” if I select “4” it shows as “45”. Then when we were locked out it gave us a one time access code and it was mixed with letters and numbers. Something like “A12B3” and imagine me trying to put in a code for being locked out only to stay locked out. Lol. It was a cluster of MESS!

The seller did say I could return the product. However, it was after I was asked to try doing a hard reset. I had the computer for literally less than a day. If I have to do a hard reset that soon, it’s a no for me.

,"Just picked up one of these w/Windows 11 at Walmart for $229 and I gotta say, for basic computing/web surfing it's pretty damn snappy. Even with 4GB of RAM this thing flies. With the 8GB of RAM I added, it's the fastest laptop I've ever had. A nice keyboard and decent screen quality make this a worthy consideration, especially for such a low price. The quibbles: both the sound quality and camera quality are decidedly low end but that's what you get with an inexpensive laptop. The overall design is bland and utilitarian but it's acceptable. The battery life is probably 4.5 hours - not the best but I keep mine mostly plugged in so it's not a big deal.

My last low-end Lenovo laptop is still running after five years so I've no doubt that with proper care this one will last me just as long. Way to go, Lenovo!"," February 4, 2023",4.0
Sound not loud enough very low trued all sound options still not loud,"First off, this won't be the value king on the market - at least at the price of March 2022, but the laptop does makeup in other areas that cheaper laptops may not have:

Build quality, the device may be plastic but it does feel sturdy and would probably not have any issues with small drops. The keyboard does not have that much flex in comparison to other thin laptops on the market at this price point.
Fingerprint sensor, I am not the biggest fan of Windows hello so having a fingerprint sensor is nice for me as well as having a physical webcam cover, something that appears to be exclusive to Lenovos in the laptop market.
The IPS 1080p screen is a joy to use and has enough brightness if the sun happens to be gleaming on it.

Now the issue with this device is the specifications in comparison to what else is on the market. As of writing this, the Asus Vivobook has two different SKUs that sit at 400 and 300 respectively. For this price, you get double the storage and ram, but the main difference is the screen. A majority of people will appreciate a full HD screen, but the issues of storage and ram will come into an issue while having multiple programs open or trying to store many photos/videos on the device. The point is, for the price Lenovo is fine but other better-valued products that may be a better choice for many are on the market. It's a fine laptop but nothing crazy.

I used this laptop for browsing the internet while on the couch, remoting into a work computer, and editing a few documents while out of the house - it did all of those without any issue. Battery life is fine but it does use a barrel charger without the ability to use a USB-C charger (especially since there is only USB-A on this device).

Overall, this would be a fine laptop if you need the occasional need for Windows where you usually use a tablet or phone for most of your computing needs."," March 10, 2022",4.0
,"As of this review, this machine is retailing for $399. I guess considering the systems I have tested in the last few months, I honestly can't justify the asking price. While this laptop does perform quite well and can even do some mild gaming, it falls short on specs. You get only 128 gigs of space, only 4 gigs of RAM, and it comes in S mode. While S mode is not much of a big deal and is easy to switch out of for those who have done it numerous times, this will be a pain for the average consumer when they go and install something as basic as Chrome or Firefox. I seriously wish S mode were an option for Administrators to put the machine into instead of take out of. I get the whole security thing, but sheesh.. Anyways, almost all laptops I review will get a star subtracted if they come with 4 gigs of RAM or less. Windows 10 runs best with a MINIMUM of 8 gigs, heck even 6 gigs would have been OK. 4 gigs...ugh.. So anyways, I checked the ram, which is soldered onto the motherboard (another star deduction). It runs at 2667 speed, which means if you upgrade to a faster speed memory, you are stuck with 2667 speeds. In addition to that, you only have 1 free slot available so you can bump it up to 8,12, or 20 gigs. I chose to bump this one up to 8 gigs which absolutely made it a bit more snappy. Next is that sad 128 gig drive, not only is this a weak capacity, but it's a pretty slow drive. I changed it out for a higher capacity nVME drive and man did that improve boot speed. Another thing I noticed while I had it open, is there is a spot to mount a 2.5"" sata drive, but there is no cable connecting it to the board. I mean, you can get one for about $10, but it would have been nice if they included one so I could have tossed in another secondary drive. Another annoyance, no USB-C !! Isn't USB-C pretty much a given standard these days? Should have ditched the single USB 2.0 port and put a type C there instead. This also has no ethernet jack on it, so you'll need to buy an adapter if you want ethernet instead of Wi-Fi. The screen on this is also kind of disappointing. Most Lenovo's I have tested have outstanding screens, this one, just isn't very bright and not as vibrant as other Lenovos I have tested. All in all, I think this is a ""just OK"" machine good for casual use, the price is a bit much, I think this would be better suited in the $299 range, perhaps even $249. Giving this model a very weak 3 stars, almost tempted to give it 2 stars but I'm feeling a tad generous today. Recommendation for Lenovo, is bump it up to a 256gig drive with 8 gigs of RAM, ditch that S mode and I think this laptop would be more inline with it's current asking price."," September 22, 2021",4.0
Great Laptop for the Money,"Depending on what you need in a laptop this might have the right cost to benefit ratio for you. It certainly isn't a high powered machine but it is responsive, has a good screen and while the keyboard is a little mushy it's not bad.

It took less than an hour to get it setup from factory new to the point I was ready to use it for anything. I spend most of my time on Macs so this will never be my main machine but it will be used to check work I do in web design and video production for the web. That said, I skipped the offer for Microsoft Office (you may want that, but I use Open Office in the Windows environment) and I downloaded copies of Chrome and Firefox so I had other browsers than the one that comes with this Lenovo. They all were up and running without any glitches or problems.

When I fired up DaVinci Resolve for the first time it did warn me that the graphics processor in this laptop might not be able to handle some color grading tasks but that wasn't a big surprise. It did say that it would be fine for working in 1080 resolution and it will be able to deal with basic color correction. Again, for me this isn't an issue since I work in Final Cut on the Mac but it's nice to have a alternative available if needed. However, this might also be a deterrent for those looking for a portable gaming machine. I don't do those, either, so this is just a heads up if you do.

The sound is somewhat disappointing. That's to be expected in a lot of low cost laptops and this one does seem to be pretty average in that area. If sound is important to you then I'd invest in a good set of earphones or speakers if this is going to be your main source of music or online audio.

Like so many machines these days it is light on ports. It does have USB2 and USB3 and as a videographer I love that it still sports a card slot. There is also an HDMI port for output to a TV or monitor. That's a plus.

The ports are important because one of the things that will almost always be attached to this is an external SSD or hard drive to compensate for the smallish internal drive. Video files get large. I do video. 128GB just isn't enough.

I like the fact that power is supplied by a wall-wart and a long cable rather than the configuration with a AC cord running from the wall to a power brick and then another wire running to the computer. It's just a cleaner arrangement than found in other computers and Lenovo gets a high-five on that design.

All in all this gets a good grade as a decent machine at a decent price for general use. You could do worse."," September 20, 2021",4.0
,"This is an entry-level productivity laptop. You will get 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD with it, which is not much, but if you want something for basic computing than that is enough to get you going. The laptop has a 14"" IPS display, and has an aluminum unibody design with a brushed metal effect on the outside of the lid. The laptop has an SD card reader on the right side and a combo mic/headphone port. On the left side there are 3 USB ports (2 USB 3.0 and 1 USB 2.0). There is also a full-sized HDMI port, and also the AC port.

The laptop has a black bezel around the display. The bezel could have been made smaller but it is not obtrusive. The bezel also holds a webcam. This laptop has a built-in privacy shutter that you can slide across to prevent the camera from broadcasting any image by accident, which is something that I wish all laptops came with standard. They keys are the typical Lenovo type, which is square on all sides but the bottom, which is curved. I wish the keys were backlit, but then that would have meant an increase in price plus battery drain.

The processor on the laptop is dual-core, which is below what I would think most modern laptops would come with. I would expect at least a quad-core processor, but this is not meant to be anything other than a basic use computer. One of the neat things about this laptop is that it has a fingerprint scanner, which means you can use it to log into Windows with Windows Hello. This computer comes with Windows 10 in S mode, which means that by default it can only install apps from the app store. You can get a free one-time upgrade to Windows 10 Home, which will allow you to install apps from anywhere, but you cannot go back to S mode if you upgrade.

There are other entry-level laptops that cost a bit less than this one. It is a good computer but could use more RAM and a better processor. It does have things like an extra USB port, an IPS display, and a fingerprint scanner that a lot of other laptops would not have. It is up to you if you would prefer those things or better specs. I do like this laptop and would recommend it, but try to get it on sale."," October 23, 2021",4.0
Good quality computer for those who need web/office tasks but value isn't there,"For the $400 that this laptop is currently priced at, I think that it is an exceptional value. Usually, at this price, you can find something that is good enough, while having some compromises. This Lenovo IdeaPad exceeds the basic requirements, and even throws in a few extras like a fingerprint scanner. This is something it is pretty rare to see at this price, especially when coupled with a nice, IPS LCD display. Usually you would get a TN LCD screen, and those are substantially lower quality and harder to look at, for work or entertainment.

The processor in this laptop is a tenth generation, Intel Core i3. This is a dual-core, four thread CPU and it performs pretty well in this specific machine. I think it has enough performance capability for the average person, it is not a powerhouse but it has fairly strong single core performance. While I was testing the laptop out, everything I did felt really zippy and responsive. If you were to try and play games on this computer, I think that is the place that the chip would start to have problems, but anything short of playing serious games should be fine.

If you want to maximize performance, I recommend installing a 4GB stick of 2666MHz DDR4 Ram. This will allow it to function in dual channel memory mode, and it made a noticeable difference for me after I installed the upgrade. The only other thing you can really change would be to install a larger capacity NVMe M.2 SSD, it uses a 2242 size. There is also a place that you could install a 2.5 inch drive, but on my IdeaPad 3, there was no SATA cable to plug into it, nor was there one included in the box. Not really sure what is up with that.

You get 3x USB A ports, 1x HDMI port, 1x headphone and mic jack, 1x SD card slot. I wish they could have included just one USB C port, for connecting newer devices/accessories. The wall adapter uses a barrel plug and is 65 watts in capacity, making it on the larger size. I do like that it’s the kind where the main brick plugs directly into the wall, instead of the kind where the brick is in the middle with cables on both sides (which is what you usually get on more affordable laptops).

The keyboard is really good, like most Lenovo laptops, even ones that cost less than this model. The trackpad is nice and smooth to scroll and move the pointer around, clicking it feels a little cheap though. It’s not bad, I would give it a 3/5, so pretty much in the middle. The webcam was a physical shutter to cover up the lens, this is good for privacy and I like seeing this feature. It’s good to know that Lenovo cares enough about user privacy to implement this feature, all webcams should have this in my opinion. I like the color scheme on this laptop too, the silver on the lid and the keyboard deck goes nicely with the grey accent on the bottom. I really have no major issues with this laptop except that 4GB of Ram is just not enough for Windows 10, not really. And also the lack of USB C is unfortunate.

Pros+

High quality IPS LCD screen which is much better than the usual TN type LCDs you get at this price

SSD is NVMe, not SATA (so you get faster speeds)

Fingerprint scanner for unlocking the computer easily with Windows Hello

RAM is easily upgradeable

Good quality keyboard

Nice design that doesn’t look or feel cheap

This laptop has a very cheap feel, with a plastic case that feels flimsy. The keyboard feels incredibly cheap as well. While the keys themselves are fine, the entire keyboard sags a bit while typing due to insufficient support underneath. Also, the edges of the keyboard where the arms rest are especially sharp, making it fairly uncomfortable to use even for a short time. The trackpad fares a bit better. It is reasonably responsive to both tap and click.

The display simply looks bad. The colors, brightness, contrast, and viewing angles are all poor, and it is not suitable for media creation. The sound is loud enough, and does not distort much at full volume. It lacks any bass, however, and is poor for any sort of media consumption. I could not test the camera, as it came visibly scratched to the point of being unusable. I found this especially odd, since it was covered with a sticker that must have been placed by hand.

Surprisingly, this computer has no USB-C port, which is pretty standard on laptops of any sort these days. That means the only charging option is a fairly fragile barrel connector. The rest of the ports include HDMI, three USB-A, audio out, and an SD card slot. The laptop does have a very nice fingerprint reader included on the power button, as well as an integrated privacy shutter on the camera.

Overall, I’m fairly disappointed in this laptop. I’m a big fan of Lenovo’s laptop lines, but I think that they made too many compromises here trying to compete with the mid-range Chromebook market. I would consider looking at virtually any other machine instead."," September 22, 2021",4.0

,"About four months ago, I reviewed a popular, but disappointing Acer Aspire 5 (A515-56-36UT, 2021) slim 15.6″ laptop. Performance was quite good for its $400 price tag, and as much as I wanted to like it, its washed-out, dull display drove me crazy with the poor viewing angles. Then came along the 14″ Lenovo IdeaPad 3 (14IIL05/81WD, 2021) laptop with an older Intel processor for the same price. One would think the Lenovo to be worse as a result, but surprisingly, it held up pretty well against the Acer.

I have been in the professional IT industry for over 18 years and tinker with technology all the time for both work and fun. I am an enthusiast through-and-through who likes to explore the latest in the industry. For this particular review of the 14″ Lenovo IdeaPad 3 (81WD010QUS, 2021), my extensive experience with Android, Apple iOS, and Windows phones and tablets will lend a helping hand in understanding what this laptop may or may not be suitable for. I had also recently reviewed a HP Chromebook 14 and will provide some comparisons for those of you considering Google’s ChromeOS laptops.

IN A NUTSHELL
This 2021 Lenovo IdeaPad 3 laptop with Intel’s Core i3-1005G1 processor (released in Q3 2019) is a solid, general-purpose laptop with a decent, 35Wh battery life of about 6-8 hours, depending on what you do with it. It handled office type work and internet browsing very well (as expected in today’s computing), but struggled with heavy photo or video editing with long delays. Intel’s Core i3 processor is not meant for performance but makes up for it with great battery life. When pitted against the Acer Aspire 5 (A515-56-36UT) in a head-to-head speed comparison, it performed about 5-8% slower on average. To most consumers, myself included, that difference was so negligible, it would not be noticeable in daily usage.

Where the Lenovo stood out in a meaningful way was its display: it was a vibrant, beautiful IPS screen with a 1920×1080 FHD resolution and 250 nits of brightness. At a diagonally-measured 14″ size, that put out some crisp-looking text, and better yet — the screen could be viewed from nearly any angle. This hit me with much surprise after the frustration and disappointment the Acer invoked not too long ago with its abysmal, dull display that only had a very narrow range of optimal viewpoints. The screen’s 16:9 wide aspect ratio makes it suitable for watching movies. Sitting right on top of the Lenovo’s display is its 0.3MP 720p camera with a hardware privacy shutter.

Performance could be enhanced with an additional, 4GB or 8GB DDR4-2666 memory module (for up to 12GB total max) — a simple process if you have opened up a computer before. Its 128GB of M.2 SSD storage (2242) is plenty of space and speed for the average consumer, and an integrated SD memory card reader helps transfer photos from one’s camera for backup or editing. The storage can be upgraded with an additional 2.5″ SATA HDD (up to 1TB), and the included SSD could be swapped with up to 512GB (with M.2 2242) or 1TB (with M.2 2280). That makes for some pretty impressive expansion options for a budget laptop.

SSD M.2 Numbers: The first two digits correspond to the width of the drive. The last two is the length. Example: 2242 refers to 22mm width, 42mm length.

The laptop has a fingerprint scanner built into the power button itself, and when used with Windows Hello, makes for quick logins using just your fingerprint. The built-in camera, however, does not support Windows Hello, and so there is no authentication available via facial recognition.

My biggest gripe with the Lenovo was its bland exterior look and design. It was too minimalist and cheap-looking for my taste and was thick in comparison with the Acer. However, its keyboard layout and performance was far more pleasurable to use, and its screen could be angled completely flat to 180 degrees. Acer’s only went to 130 degrees and made usage even the more frustrating when considered with its limited viewing angles. To add a 2.5″ hard drive, Lenovo unfortunately did not include a SATA cable (#5C10S30041 14IIL05). Its keyboard is not backlit, and its barrel-plug wall charger has a non-retractable prong. All of that, however, was to be expected for a laptop of this price range.

Overall, even though the Lenovo was using an older Intel processor than the Acer, I found the IdeaPad 3 to be much more of a joy to use. Its viewable, vibrant display did not force me to conform to its limitations like the Acer did with its abysmal screen, and the responsive keyboard (alas non-backlit) with the right layout added to a more productive experience. This Lenovo with its minimalist, thick, dull exterior is like a reliable, fun friend you can trust. Whereas the Acer would relatively be the hotter, prettier person you quickly got tired of looking at for more than a few minutes. Go with the Lenovo.

HARDWARE DESIGN
Its exterior design is very minimalist, dull, but light enough (4 lbs) to hold one handed, but unlike the Microsoft Surface Pro, your arms will eventually tire out. The lid can be opened up to 180 degrees with one hand with very little flex, and its screen is a beautiful, vibrant, 1920×1080 FHD resolution that produces crisp text and sharp images at its 14″ diagonal size. The Surface Pro’s display is far superior, but at the Lenovo’s price range, one cannot compare both computers directly with one another. That would have been unfair competition.

The Lenovo IdeaPad 3’s depressingly dark gray, thick, cheap-looking exterior leaves a lot to be desired in the graphics design department, but makes up for it with a snappy keyboard whose keys are well-laid out. Neither the Lenovo nor the Acer scream “premium”, but what should one expect at $400?

PERFORMANCE
The memory and storage can both be upgraded thanks to an extra RAM and 2.5″ SATA drive slots. You can achieve significantly more performance by upgrading the included 4GB memory with an additional 4GB (for dual-channel mode) or 8GB stick (for a total of 8 or 12GB). I suggest you get one from Crucial, Kingston, Samsung, Micron, or Hynix by searching for “DDR4 SODIMM” (either 2666 or faster 3200). Upgrading is a simple matter of powering off the laptop, removing the battery, touching a grounded metal to remove static from your body, then opening the screws at the bottom of the laptop, and carefully inserting the new part(s) without any force. (See Hardware Manual, Page 40)

Intel’s Core i3-1005G1 processor is dual-core to allow for multiple applications to run more efficiently (and it does so significantly faster than its predecessors), and the built-in Intel UHD G1 graphics processor is capable of light, casual gaming, including Grand Theft Auto 5 at 720p, 30 FPS with some lowered settings. That’s not bad for a 2019-era budget processor. It is not as speedy as the Acer Aspire 5 (2021) that could run League of Legends, Fortnite, NBA 2K21, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Minecraft, and even Battlefield 1 at a slightly higher resolution.

Wireless performance was in line with WiFi 5 expectations. It does not support the new WiFi 6 standard, but you would not really miss much for years to come since WiFi 6 is still far from ubiquitous in real world usage.

Speaker volume and output is as expected for a laptop of this class: tinny and just loud enough to comfortably watch a movie with in a small, quiet room. Typing and using the touchpad felt natural, and the extended keys were where I expected them to be. I was disappointed to see Lenovo ship the laptop with a proprietary barrel plug instead of using USB-C. Its AC prong also cannot be folded away.

OPERATING SYSTEM
Windows 10 S is included — a version of Microsoft’s operating system that promised more secure, faster, reliable computing in its bid to compete against Chromebooks. Microsoft had previously tried with the ill-received Windows RT, and like that one, Windows S had also become a failure in that the market still is not ready to give up the compatibility to run legacy applications that Windows had been known for. Thankfully, there is an easy, one-way to upgrade to the full Windows 10 Home experience for free. This laptop has TPM 2.0 built-in, making it ready for a free upgrade to Windows 11.

Compared to a Chromebook, I much prefer this Lenovo because it comes with full computing functionality. Chromebook had been doing very well in the education sector, but nothing compares to having the flexibility to run and do anything with your laptop that runs a full version of Windows. So, although Chromebook (like HP’s Chromebook 14) excels in all-day battery life (10+ hours), I would pick this Lenovo over it despite the slightly higher price.

I am a huge supporter of the Microsoft Surface Pro, Surface 3, and Surface Go type form factor. However, one of their biggest disadvantages is that they are not entirely comfortable to use on your lap as their kickstands dig into your skin. That is where laptops excel: sitting comfortably on your lap — that is, if you can withstand the heat that some powerhouse computers put out. Thankfully, this Lenovo does not create too high of a heat due to its use of Intel’s lower-powered Core i3 processor.

OVERALL IMPRESSION
This Lenovo IdeaPad 3 makes for a great, day-to-day, no-frills computer for casual work, web browsing, media consumption, gaming, and Windows Store app usage. Its display is vibrant, beautiful and can be seen from a wide range of angles. It can also be flipped a full, 180 degrees and thus allows you to position the screen to fit your workflow. The Acer Aspire 5, on the other hand, forced me to accommodate myself to its limited 130-degree maximum angle (with a very poor screen to boot), dictating how I sat or held the laptop. For that very reason alone, the Lenovo comes with a much higher recommendation despite running a slower processor that resulted in about 5-8% less (but not noticeable) performance.

The laptop has some good memory and storage space upgrade options that can easily be accessed through removal of its bottom cover. It supports Windows 11 and has a snappy response with Windows Hello through its fingerprint scanner for convenient unlocking, though the built-in camera is not supported for authentication via facial recognition.

I previously stated that the Lenovo’s thick, boring, minimalist exterior was like a trustworthy, reliable, fun friend who helped you be productive. Whereby the Acer was the prettier computer whose very poor screen made it the flashy, hot-looking, but frustrating person to be with. The Lenovo easily earned my recommendation over the Acer. It makes for a great, inexpensive travel laptop that I would not shed a tear for if it broke or got stolen — just make sure you enable drive encryption so thieves cannot get to your data.

REFERENCES
Read on to learn more about what CPUs, WiFi 6 (vs 5), Chromebooks, and the disk storage differences are.

WHAT IS AN INTEL PROCESSOR?
The CPU (processor), the “brain” of a computer, is an important piece to gauge performance. It is responsible for processing all the general calculations and instructions to carry out everything an electronic device can do. The faster it can “think”, the faster things will get done.

Intel has maintained a significant lead in the computer industry with only AMD having been its noteworthy rival for decades. AMD had actually made a significant comeback with its Ryzen product line to compete against Intel’s flagship “Core”. The numbering scheme for Intel goes like this (from lowest to highest performance): i3, i5, i7, and i9. AMD’s Ryzen series mirrors that. Essentially Intel’s Core i3 is the least expensive and targets consumers wanting a basic computer to do basic things like web browsing, office work, media consumption, and casual gaming with better battery life than the higher models. Core i7 and i9 target hardcore users who want top-notch performance.

WHAT IS WIFI 6?
The new WiFi standard is not just about speed. It can more efficiently send data to multiple devices at once (like a delivery driver stopping by multiple clients on the way to the final customer), improve battery life, and security. However, the router and devices must all support the new 802.11ax standard for the benefits to be realized.

WiFi 6 is 100% backwards compatible with WiFi 5 and older devices and as such is more future proof.

WHAT IS A CHROMEBOOK?
It is important to first and foremost understand that Chromebook is precisely that — a laptop (notebook) based on Google's Chrome operating system (OS), software that allows you to use and interact with the hardware. It offers a minimalistic, web browser experience that is far different from Windows and MacOS, but may appear familiar to Android users.

Newer Chromebooks offer the Google Play Store from which you can download apps, games, and consume books, music, and movies — just like a Samsung smartphone or Google TV device. It also offers apps from the Google Chrome Web Store that are very limited in functionality but can enhance the web browsing experience with extensions (plugins).

Chrome OS is today's dominant computing system used within the Education market, an area that Microsoft had been trying to challenge with its failed Windows RT and Windows S-Mode efforts. Apple, too, trails behind Google's Chromebook platform. Unlike Windows and MacOS native programs, however, most web apps within Chrome OS cannot be used without having internet access. A subset and many Google Play Store apps can, such as Netflix and Gmail.

In Short: Chrome OS, which was launched in 2011, very much feels like an Android tablet slapped onto a laptop form factor. It does not offer a full PC/Mac experience and essentially is a (usually) low-cost/low-powered computer whose main interface is the Google Chrome web browser.

I much prefer a Windows laptop over Chrome OS for everyday computing (like this Lenovo IdeaPad 3 or Microsoft Surface Go 2), even if I had to pay a bit more for that flexibility. However, the education sector does prefer the latter like the one that powers the HP Chromebook 14.

STORAGE AND EXPANSION
Installation/Upgrade: SATA/M.2 SSD/Memory

Replacing or adding a 2.5″ SATA drive, M.2 SSD, or RAM is generally hassle-free. Simply pop off the screws found at the bottom of a computer to reveal the storage/memory slots. Be sure to educate yourself about which parts to buy, as I will explain below.

Drive Differences: SATA, SSD, mSATA, M.2, NVMe

Hard disk drives (HDD) are mechanical devices whose performance was primarily based on the RPM (revolutions per minute) rating. They were generally 5400 or 7200 RPM (and beyond) — the higher the number, the faster it would usually perform. As with anything mechanical, they break down over time as the components age.

Flash-memory based Solid State Drives (SSD) were introduced in the 1990s and were VERY expensive. SSD promised resistance to physical shock, faster performance, lower heat output, and more silent operation. Even to this day, SSDs still cost more than similarly-sized HDDs.

SSD and HDD connect to your computer via multiple interfaces. Relative to most Mini PCs and Laptops, we are only concerned with the SATA and PCIe ones. SATA can connect two drive types:

- 2.5″ SATA SSD (nowadays used in most laptops and desktop PCs and is physically larger)
- mSATA and M.2 SSD (typically used in Mini PCs and laptops), each with their own connection types

Mini-SATA (mSATA) is older and slower than M.2, and the latter can also connect to the newer, significantly faster PCIe interface (those drives are known as NVMe M.2 SSD).

M.2 SSD 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280? What do they mean?

- The first two digits correspond to the width of the drive
- The last two are the length

A M.2 SSD 2280 is 22mm wide and 80mm long. This is important to know, especially with Mini PCs or Laptops where space is scarce. If you purchase a 2280 drive and the computer only has room for 2230, you would not be able to use the former."," October 19, 2021",4.0

,"Anyone looking at Chromebooks these days, and trying to choose one, is in for quite the ride. So many to choose from, and at so many price points and feature sets.

This is my first adventure into a Chromebook, and I did so because it looks like the OS is pretty mature now days, and manufacturers are putting together designs with great feature sets at very aggressive prices.

Anyway, this is the initial Chromebook I chose to start my adventure with, precisely because it offered the correct blend of features and pricing. I was tempted to go straight into a Pixel-Go.. but heard repeated reports of weak chassis and breaking hinges. So I thought.. hey.. go with a lower end unit initially because that will give you true view of the adaptability and power of Chrome OS.

This unit fired up right out of the box, with no issues, and did all it's configuration and automatic updates within 10 minutes of power on. Very simple, very smooth.

One thing that led me to this model and brand of Chromebook was Acers has put a great set of I/O connections in the design. You get two USB-C, two USB A 3.1s, the typical audio jack, and frankly that is about all I ever expect to need on a Chromebook.

It was important for me to find a Chromebook design that was truly fanless (ie: self cooled), and the N4000 processor makes this easy and efficient. I plant to use this machine in a variety of locations where dust, lint, etc is troublesome for most laptops with fans

Keyboard response is smooth and comfortable.

Unit is light weight, and for a 14 inch display, very respectable physical dimensions. Chassis feels strong and rugged.

Display is fabulous, being a full 1080P display, with plenty of brightness and contrast.

The unit comes with ~ 15gb of the 64 used for the OS and other files right out of the box.
It is fast, and responsive, and of course it runs the Chrome browser extremely well so that little Celeron N4000 series processor is working nicely. Given that in the laptop space these days.. the processor is likely the most expensive component... going with the N4000 instead of a i3 variant processor helps notably reduce cost/price.

Battery life is superb. I ran a test last night.. leaving it on with the display active and Chrome open on an active web page and after 8.5 hours, it still reported 6 more hours of battery left. Of course with more activity, more current and less battery life, but this test overnight gives me a great initial baseline.

There are still things about Chrome OS that can and will be improved, but this is true regardless of which machine you may choose.

Time will tell how many years it will last, but at this price point it really is a disposable recyclable unit when the time comes. But right out of the box, I am extremely pleased with my purchase."," May 25, 2021",5.0
Excellent Chromebook,"I just received my Acer Chromebook a few days ago and, currently I’m still navigating my way through. My current computer is a very old, outdated laptop. Since, I haven’t had much experience with the Chromebook so far it’s fabulous! The set up was easy, log in with my gmail account and I was good to go. The battery life is impressive, I have not charged my Chromebook since the initial charge three days ago. ( I do power off my device when not in use). It’s a great computer for the price, less than $300. I recommend the Acer Chromebook for anyone using it for on line banking, shopping, and email.

Great computer for home use,"From the picture you can see I am writing the review on this computer right now. The little pink sticky is covering the webcam, if you were at all curious. It is a great little addition to my computer family and it makes it easy for me to do quick computer requests and work when needed. It starts super fast and it is really easy to use. I would say buy yourself a Logitech Bluetooth mouse and it will make everything easier. The only drawback to this machine is that it isn't a Touch Screen. If you can live without that, then this is a fantastic addition to your house, work, or school. I added a 128 Gb microSD card to save anything I download or any documents I create. This saves space for any additional applications you may need. If you have never used a Chromebook, think of it like a tablet that you can type on and have a regular browser to use. All apps are downloaded from the Google Play store, don't mind if it says telephone only, most of them work just fine. Just a tip, I downloaded McAfee Safe Connect and McAfee Security by T-Mobile for safe web browsing and doing my banking. Don't use a free virus protector, pay for it.

The Full HD screen 1080 p is good but not as good as my Dell laptop. But overall it's as good and lighter and nicer to type with as my backlit Dell. I thought I would miss that feature but have not.

I still have no clue where the saves were going since I do not used cloud storage because I do not trust it. I have a lot of data and well its mine. So even if your data starts on a memory stick it isn't saved there on a chromebook.

I just bought this machine. I've got it mostly tweaked to hubby's needs. I'm adjusting to ChromeOS. We're both impressed with the speed and the screen. I would give this 5 stars, except... I can't cast it to the TV. I have a known good HDMI cable going direct to the TV, no switch. I got a USB-C to HDMI adapter. No go. Tried another new adapter, different brand, just in case it was a cable problem. Still no go. Both put the Acer launch screen on the TV, even when Chrome shows on the laptop screen. There's no mouse on the TV. I searched for any help, anyone else with similar problems. Nothing. I'll happily upgrade my review if I can find a solution."," February 20, 2021",5.0
Great little computer helper,"I really wanted to like this. I bought this thinking Chrome OS would be similar to Windows. It runs more like a phone or tablet. The system is based on a Google/Gmail account (your password/login is your email and your password). This would be great for leisure use but I wanted a work computer. And after I turned it on, I realized I couldn’t install the Microsoft 365 suite for Windows on it. I’d have to go onto Google Play and install each program (i.e. Excel) separately and pay separately. Costing more and doesn’t have good reviews. It may just be too new for other programs like Photoshop to be available for it (I didn’t even look because it was getting to be too much work). Sadly I returned it. I really wanted to like this.
If it was just for browsing the web, emails and watching Netflix, it’s a great laptop for that. It’s fast, incredibly light and the screen comes right to the edge, making it very sleek."," October 17, 2020",5.0
,"Chromebook seemed fine and all of a sudden died. TECHNICAL WARRANTY SUPPORT IS DEFICIENT. There are no service centers nationwide. The broken computer has to be sent to a regional hub and it can take serval weeks to get repaired. Counting the time of a warranty claim, it can take up to 8 weeks to get it back. 60 days without a computer is not reasonable. Fortunately, Amazon agreed and helped authorizing a return."," May 2, 2023",5.0

,"I have the smaller Chromebook and have been satisfied with it as I use it daily (now in fact), as it's light and sits beside me at all times. The larger one filled my need to be able to view some files without having to manipulate them on the screen. Fast, efficient and avoiding the ""windows"" nightmare I used to have. Seems their ""auto updates"" wiped out 2 hard drives in past, but no such problem after going to chrome.
The new larger version also has a faster recharge speed and uses the C style connection to recharge instead of the plug as on my older Chromebook. That was a weakness as the plugs stopped working after a year or so and required a new charger. Wish Acer has a way to change old style to new style charger port. 3rd chromebook, so very happy with system and product and price is attractive also."," February 8, 2021",5.0
Just what I wanted,I love the color and the speed. I use mine for everyday stuff so it works great for my needs.," July 15, 2022",5.0
,"Overall, this is an excellent Chromebook. Easy to use right out of the box. But there are a few frustrating design flaws. First, the left shift key was placed an entire row down because for some reason they felt it was necessary to put a random “search” button right where the shift key would go! So if you are an experienced typist, every time you go to make a capital letter, you hit the very disruptive search key and an entire search window opens. It’s beyond annoying and it really makes fluid typing difficult. I would never have purchased it for this one problem!
Another design problem is how hard you have to press down on the touchpad in order to perform functions with it, it actually starts to be a big effort.
Not looking for things to complain about, but these “little” things have caused me to dread using this machine just a few days in. Far from a smooth use each time!"," June 13, 2020",5.0
Love the color,"I got this because I wanted the processing, storage and RAM to run linux apps, deal with larger files, etc.

Mostly the lesser models work for me most of the time, and for the money are great. This one, however, has a backlit keyboard, feel of the keys and fingerprint reader are great! Being able to run certain programs, like Thunderbird, really changes the Chromebook experience in nice ways.

I almost never use the touchscreen, so that's not a big deal (though it works great). Battery life is good, though not as good as a lower end model, like the 14"" Acer.

Overall, I'm happy with it."," December 25, 2020",5.0
,"I bought this as a gift to replace my bfs Toshiba 13334 chromebook from 2014. The Toshiba had begun to disconnect itself from the wifi on a regular basis. Power washing it did nothing. Since it reached it's expiration date I bought this to replace it. It's around the same weight but the screen on this is larger. Set up was very simple and there were no issues. My bf uses it mostly to surf the web and watches TONS of videos. Since I have not heard any cursing regarding the use of his computer, I say it's a win. He reports it feels faster overall and it hasn't dropped the wifi connection since he begun using it around mid November. Overall a great buy."," January 20, 2021",5.0
I want to love it but...,"The processing speed is much slower than I expected, but it does have a great battery life. It has rough edges instead of a smooth bevel as described."," September 26, 2022",5.0
,"*Please note that I have only owned this laptop for a few days*

So far I am yet to have a problem. It has been fantastic for getting simple little tasks done, watching videos, writing papers, etc. In my case, Windows isn't an important feature so Chrome OS has been a convenient switch. Setting it up SUPER easy (I think the part that took the longest was setting up the ""Ok Google"" feature). The battery life and charging speed is also exceptional. The only inconveniences so far are that there are no keys for ""delete"" or ""caps lock"" (caps lock can be activated by pressing alt and the search key that replaced it) Overall, a fantastic purchase especially for a student."," December 5, 2020",5.0
Good Value,"While a great computer -- replaced a prior generation Acer 14 Chromebook that was four years old and still running mostly well -- what I did not expect was the blue color. According to the box, the color is called ""Dew Silver"". Anyway you look at it, it is blue, Ice Blue. Only the trackpad is sliver. Thought I was getting regular old silver just as shown on the screen....and nothing in the Amazon page or seller info said anything about a color choice at all, nor was color mentioned anywhere in the description. Luckily, I'm ok with the color -- it isn't obnoxious -- but still, it should have been disclosed prior to the sale."," January 15, 2021",5.0
,"I purchased this because I am tired of laptops that run Windows crashing two to three years after purchase. I read a review on this Chromebook where the user said it's a perfect computer if you don't have much to do with it. And that description fits me perfectly. It is a great computer for watching Netflix, checking email, doing basic online and word processing stuff. Also, it is lighting quick on startup. It's almost hard to believe I put up with Windows for so long. This computer is very user friendly, I wish I would have purchased one sooner. Great laptop overall, I can't see a reason why I'd ever go back to Windows."," December 9, 2020",5.0

,"My 314 Acer chromebook arrived on my front porch no announcement like ringing my illuminated doorbell, found it by accident while looking for the prognosticated snowfall. Opened it to find no soft sided travel case like the last Acer I bought.

Bare bones,"This is my first netbook. Must admit, I was a bit skeptical after so many years with computers. Not really being into more compute power. This is far more better than expected.
First. It's much faster.
Second. There are updates. But not as intrusive and constant.
Third. I can do just as much as I personally did before. The more recent netbooks can be printed from. Some may require some tweaking, but it's doable.

Fast. Ease of use.,"With an old iMac and old iPhone, and unable to afford to replace them with expensive new models, I was so frustrated not being able to access most updated websites any longer. This Chromebook is the perfect, inexpensive alternative. Loving it so far. Easy to figure it out. So much faster than my old iMac. I'll keep that to store my 18,000 photos and Word files and use my iPhone as an actual phone, but use this for everything online. So much more comfortable to use this on a tray table pulled up to my couch, instead of sitting stiffly at my desk. Very satisfied."," December 21, 2020",1.0

Very happy with this purchase,"I bought one, and the Caps Lock key didn't work, and then it started to slow way down. So Amazon had me return it, and sent a replacement (very quickly, but I was still several days without a computer.) The replacement has a GLARING screen problem: bleached out and painfully ultra-violet. It also has a non-functioning Caps Lock key, and the Ctrl + V is also problematic. When (at the advice of an Amazon Support person), I asked for a replacement, the company refused, but did offer a refund. I will probably take the refund eventually, but I NEED A WORKING COMPUTER!!!! (Try typing that without a Caps Lock key.)"," February 26, 2023",5.0
,"The machine was very easy to set up from my existing Google account. I ported over MS Office 365 and added all my favorite apps in a few minutes. I am more than happy with my choice. This Chromebook is fast, has great battery life, and can do everything I need. The keyboard lacks a ""delete"" key, which was awkward until I learned the shortcut workaround. I highly recommend this item."," January 14, 2021",5.0
"Inexpensive, but there's a reason for it","This computer does everything a general purpose laptop is supposed to do and does it well. I had an issue with the charger not working but customer support quickly sent me a replacement charger and it's now charging as it should. The most frustrating thing this computer does is that at times, it will not stay connected to wifi. I saw other reviews that reference the same issue. I have two laptops sitting beside each other and this is the only one that drops the wifi signal, so I know it's a computer issue and not a wifi issue. Most of the time the computer will reconnect automatically but other times I have to go into settings and force a reconnect. Sometimes once it reconnects, it'll stay connected for while. Other times, it will continuously disconnect and reconnect. (It's disconnected and reconnected 4 times as I've typed this review....)"," June 24, 2021",5.0

Chromebook 314 Notebook,"I had this monitor for almost a year and used it about once or twice a week, with my laptop for working on spreadsheets, QuickBooks, and other accounting things. I was very happy with it while it worked. I take very good care of my things and about a year after getting it the display started showing colored lines and distortions.
I won't go into the details of the customer service experience but it involved multiple emails and phone calls with people who were clearly reading from a script and despite all the ""thank you for that information"" comments, could care less about actually helping. I'm sure everyone knows how this goes.
I ended up finally getting permission to mail it to their repair center and wrapped it up very carefully. They sent me a picture of a severely damaged cracked screen and I'm skeptical that it got damaged in transit. I responded to their emails with my issues and never heard back, so all I can do now is never do business with Asus again, and try to spare someone else the same experience."," May 4, 2021",5.0

,"I love my new laptop, but the colors displayed on screen are just ok...not very vibrant, average for my own use, and can be fixed a bit tilting the screen at a better angle.

Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a ""bling"" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive.

I looked at several ""higher"" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.

Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare. This means I can chart and do notes outside without sacrificing efficiency. Overall, the only ""missing"" thing is a touch screen. My main laptop is a Surface Pro 7, so I'm not really missing this. This is a fantastic true ""lap"" top.

Unlike others, I have used other Chromebooks. This is superior for the PRICE."," February 13, 2023",5.0
Asus is a good brand name for lap tops,"The issue is that it is difficult at best to repurpose as the OS gets to the end of life and the machine is near impossible to load a light version of Linux to keep it operable. Almost every part is hard soldered to the MB. It is what it is, My last Chrome book was not updatable, and attempting to repurpose the old machine with Linux failed and killed the SSD failed and was hard soldered to the MB. At that point it was E-Wast! This machine is no different. At least a micro SD chip can be used to expand the storage. Most Chrome books no longer have that option and I see the day when all machines will not have that option. Again, it is what it is."," August 17, 2022",5.0

DETAILED REVIEW:
Asus's Chromebook is made from plastic that is nicely finished in a glossy silver, except for the bottom that is a matte silver plastic. The Asus is lightweight and easy to carry but it has a fairly large overall size that rivals my circa 2018 15"" MacBook Pro. Despite its lightweight, the Asus feels robust and does not bend or flex easily. The screen's hinges open and close smoothly and stay in your desired position well.

The larger size of the Asus means that you also get a large and nicely spaced keyboard. The keyboard is pleasant to type on and doesn't make much noise. The touch pad is also large and is sensitive to touching and tapping.

I had no issues with performance or battery life. The Asus is more than capable of surfing the web, word processing, and watching Hi-Def video. It's able to seamlessly play Netflix in a window while I simultaneously surf the web. With moderate usage, and the screen kept at a medium brightness, the battery easily lasts 8 hours. The Asus is silent in use and does not get hot.

Sadly the screen and speakers are lacking. The good parts of the screen are its lack of glare, decent brightness, and how well it performs when watching videos. Videos have vibrant but not over saturated colors, good black levels, and nice detail. The issues I take with the screen is that the color-shift is too blue and the viewing angle is narrow. Compared to Google's Pixelbook Go it is a subpar viewing experience. Still, for the price of the Asus, the screen is adequate. The speakers are less than adequate though. They are weak, tinny sounding, and placed where they are easy to block.

All in all... a fine Chromebook, with some caveats."," May 16, 2022",4.0

Horrible,"So far our family has been super impressed with this laptop. It's actually quite a bit larger than I was picturing full size screen and it's very thin and lightweight considering. Wait considering. It's not a touchscreen model which is fine I wasn't expecting it to be but if that's what you're looking for it's not this period period so far we've had no issues with functionality everything works as it's supposed to and it's running smoothly like a new computer should. Everything opens quickly and seemlessly.

This comes with the charger and any accessory you would need it's a basic silver color and could easily be decorated with stickers or laptop accessories.

The keyboard types very smoothly! It feels great typing on this as compared to my much smaller HP chromebook.. I'm honestly amazed azed at how nice it is considering the price!

This is an amazing value so far and I would highly recommend it for students or for anyone that needs a basic laptop to get them started with worker school.. We mostly wanted it to store files on and yon and use it as our home computer near my husband have personal computers but there's no computer for everyone's use and this seems perfect for that.

This doesn't come with some of the Bells and whistles that some of the more expensive brands might come with but honestly the base programs that it comprehends stalled on it are more than you need for everyday use. My daughter has used it to do school work on already and had no issues. It connected to the Internet without any problem and the battery stays charged a lot longer than my husband's computer does.

Like I said before the screen is huge way bigger than I was expecting and the display looks really nice. Great for watching videos on or possibly editing photos.

Super happy with this order and honestly for the price you just can't beat it any time you can get a decent laptop for under $300 you found an amazing deal I would absolutely order this again and highly recommend it to anyone"," April 16, 2022",5.0
,"ASUS makes great computers and this little Chromebook is no different. It's fast enough to handle the Chrome operating system with ease. This is the perfect laptop if you want to use Google Docs or YouTube. I'm personally into these quite a bit and having a little laptop with great battery life for basic stuff is great.

The keyboard is springy, and it has decent travel. The touchpad is decent. Frankly, for the price, you're getting a nice little rig. It's not going to compete with a full featured Windows 11 laptop, but it's good enough for daily use and basic needs."," May 31, 2022",5.0
Great basic laptop,"This is the first Chromebook I have owned, although I have used some before. In some ways this Chromebook is better than comparable models and in some ways it's worse. On the positive side; it has 64GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, two USB-C ports, and a full HD screen (1920 X 1080). On the negative side it has an outdated processor (Intel Celeron N3350), WiFi 5, and Bluetooth 4.2. I don't think it would have cost more than a few dollars extra to include the latest WiFi and Bluetooth chipsets, so I don't understand that decision. Fortunately, although the processor is slow, Chrome OS isn't a very demanding operating system. In the tests I have done so far, the performance has been fine. If all you want to do is browse the web, watch videos, or use Google apps; a Chromebook like this one is more than enough for most people. I think this is an excellent computer for a student. If it gets broken or lost, you're only out $250 instead of over $1,000 for most Apple or Windows laptops."," April 22, 2022",5.0
,"Overall, this is a decent laptop/Chromebook for the price. It really should be thought of as more of a glorified tablet with a keyboard, as it won’t be running any demanding software, but it is a great entry-level laptop for the price. Pros: Great price, fairly lightweight, seems pretty functional. If you break it or lose it, it wasn’t a huge investment ;)
Cons: No FN keys (can set them up in settings, but they are not printed on the keys so you’ll have to just know which one is which), no number pad, WiFi strength isn’t great (low signal in areas where my other computer still has normal signal)."," April 22, 2022",5.0

,"When I first got the Chromebook it worked for like a day and then died. It wouldn't charge the screen wouldn't turn on it just wouldn't work. Because my Amazon invoice says I paid $0 for this because it was a gift Asus wouldn't help me because technically I didn't pay for it even though I had all the information necessary. This isn't the first time I've had issues with an Asus product let alone Asus customer service. The first day when the Chromebook worked it was wonderful and exactly what I needed. It was a bit slow with Android apps but I didn't really need Android apps to begin with on the Chromebook. Basic web browsing and maybe discord.

All in all avoid Asus products because they are shoddy quality and their customer service team absolutely does not care. One of the worst experiences with customer service and laptops I've ever had"," May 25, 2022",5.0

,"I got the Ryzen 7 8Gig of RAM configuration.
When I got it, it was fast, but the main issue I had was that the Fan noise was jarring. I upgraded the RAM (Added a 16 GB chip) and love how much faster, smoother, and quieter it is.

The display took a little bit of getting used to because it's 16:10 and not 16:9, however I'm happy for the slightly more screen real-estate.

The battery is fast, and I'm happy with the build quality and how easy it is to upgrade.

Things to be mindful of:

The edges are a bit sharp, so if you do a lot of typing, make sure your wrists aren't resting directly on the edge. The fingerprint reader is a little dodgy, but I've set a pin code and am happy with that.

I LOVE the keyboard, the clicks are so satisfying (to me, I know how subjective keyboards are).

All-in-all, it's a great computer for the price. This is more than enough laptop for most people. Gamers: this one isn't for you (unless you're using gamepass or something), and for those who are business power users, this might not be perfect for you either.

"I liked it before, but now I like it even more2","Let me preface this by stating I got the version with a 5600h from amazon warehouse for $375.
This laptop is great. 16:10 touch screen looks great. I added an extra 8gb of ram to bring the total up to 16gb.

The chassis is very sturdy with hardly any flex and the keyboard feels better than other laptops I have tried in a similar/lower price range, and it comes backlit which is a plus.

The touchpad is nice and large but there is still plenty of space for your wrists to rest. The fact that you have a numpad built into the touchpad is pretty cool but I don't foresee myself ever really using it.

The speakers get an A+ for me. Keep them around 50% or lower while on your lap should be plenty loud. Audio quality is great too."," May 9, 2023",5.0

Overall fantastic laptop,"This review was made with the laptop I bought and the model is TN3402Q.
This laptop does have a really good keyboard and a large touch pad which can turn into a numpad. I initially believe the monitor on this non-OLED model will be less vivid when compared to my daily used desktop monitor, LG 27GP850. However, with my own observation of using this laptop for watching anime and Youtube, I found no particular bad colour displacement with only a few minor backlight leaks when viewing black background in a dark environment. This laptop also support charging through the type C port with 90W PD.

Although this laptop is pretty good as an all-rounder, with this laptop there are a few things that you will need to know before purchasing.

Firstly this laptop comes with a empty DDR4 slot, and as far as I know the empty slot can only accept DDR4 3200 CL22 8GB SODIMM. EDIT: I have tried installing a 32GB SODIMM and it works on this laptop!!

Secondly there is only one M.2 slot for storage and it is already preoccupied by the system drive that came with this laptop. The only way to get more storage will be a) switch out the 512GB SSD with a larger one and reinstall win11, b) get a external drive or cloud drive for extra storage. I did ended up switching the drive to a 1TB Gold P31. And by the way the official website for this laptop only provides drivers for win11 so no win10 support for this laptop.

Thirdly this laptop came with a crappy wifi card made by MTK! To be honest with you this wifi card is trash and will make this laptop unbearable for someone like me who loves surfing the net all the time. If you really want to buy this laptop you better order another replacement wifi card with it. I personally recommends Intel AX200 or AX210 wifi cards which I also got on my laptop for the optimal user experience.

Thank you for reading this long amateur review. I hope the things listed above can help someone without regretting their purchase of this laptop. It is such a good laptop only if you know what is bad and what you need to do to improve it for the long term."," October 2, 2022",5.0

It never left my desk and had no physical damage, just stopped working completely.

ASUS Vivobook S14 delivers great versatility,"Overall, this really is a pretty impressive little machine. It's done everything I've asked it to do, and then some. It mostly gets underused as a web browsing machine for my wife so she can do things online from the comfy couch rather than the basement office, but it keeps her happy which keeps me happy! I've used it for anything from simple time-killer games to 3D designing with SketchUp and it hasn't disappointed me yet. This past weekend I used it to DJ a wedding for a friend, and it ran smoothly with multiple applications going at once. I don't use it in convertible mode very often, but it's super handy to have that option when needed. The auto-rotate screen is very responsive too - just the right amount. It rotates when appropriate but isn't as jumpy as my cell phone that rotates too easily sometimes.

The only thing I don't like about it is the cooling setup. It pretty much completely depends on the air vents on the bottom of it for cooling. But it's a laptop. Its purpose is to be a computer when a desk isn't available, meaning it will literally be sitting on a lap most of the time. It's just too easy to accidentally block of the vents and cause it to overheat, which is very bad for any computer. It's super thin, so I'm sure side venting would have been pretty difficult to engineer, but it's still kind of a necessity. Keep that in mind if you're thinking about getting one. If you can make sure the vents don't get blocked, this is a great little machine. Otherwise, you may want to consider a different style or getting a cooler to sit it on.

I received this as a promotion to review, but I'm not a paid reviewer or employee. This is my honest opinion, and I will update this review if anything changes."," May 16, 2023",5.0
,"It has been really interesting reviewing this laptop. It is the first one I have ever had that is convertible between a laptop and a tablet. Build quality is quite nice and honestly it's about what you would expect for a machine at this price point so no issues there. I think the top of the computer might be aluminum as it feels like it might be but don't quote me for sure on that. I'm just going to talk about some of the major points about this unique machine and some of the things I didn't care for. Spoiler: none of them are what I would call deal breakers.

Performance is quite good with the snappy Ryzen 5 mobile processor. The only problem here is that it only has 8gb of ram! For a new computer in 2022 this just isn't acceptable. That being said upgrading that ram was pretty easy. There are about 8 or so screws on the base then just use a little plastic pry tool to get the back the rest of the way off. It was interesting to note that the 8gb of ram is actually built into the motherboard of this computer. You then get 1 standard laptop DIMM slot. I only had a single 8gb stick with me but I would be interested to see how using a 16gb stick would impact performance. Start to finish the upgrade took less than 10 minutes. I also didn't care for the nvme drive to be only 512gb. Again, for a modern computer in 2022 it should really be 1tb as the cost isn't that large between the 2. Unfortunately there is no where else I saw inside the computer to add a secondary hard drive at all. With the computer now having 16gb I noticed a big increase in speed and performance when working with multiple applications or having several tabs open in Chrome.

I was excited to test out the new Asus Pen 2.0 however this computer didn't come with one! In fact at the time of this review the Asus Pen 2.0 isn't even available in the US. I did go online and purchased one from eBay that is coming in from Hong Kong I believe. I will be sure to update my review once it arrives and I have a chance to test this computer out with it.

Converting this to a tablet was nice and easy with just a flip of the screen. It was nice to see that the hinges seemed nice and strong. The screen is nothing to get excited about but that being said it does have a 16:10 aspect ratio at a resolution of 1920x1200 so just a bit more resolution that standard 1080p HD. Colors and contrast looked good and certainly bright enough for doing detail work indoors. The touch features with just using my fingers worked well.

The keyboard and trackpad setup here is really nice. They keys have a little scoop in them and it felt a bit more comfortable to type on that your average keyboard. The trackpad worked well and the little numpad feature is kinda cool. Just press the little numpad icon on the track pad and then lighting underneath the trackpad illuminates and you have what looks like a projection of a numpad right there on your trackpad. This isn't something I have seen before and if you are someone that loves having a numpad for work stuff, this might be a huge feature for you. There is a thumbprint sensor on one of the keyboard keys and that has been working quite well as well.

All in all I am impressed with this really unique computer. Were it not for the paltry amount of memory and HD space this would have been a 5 star review for me."," September 8, 2022",5.0
A good dual purpose machines (tablet/laptop),"This laptop is one that'd I'd best describe as just enough pep to do what you need it for. That's basically how it is in all categories. It won't be the leader or best in anything, but it's enough to remain competitive. I'll just summarize my comments from the past week of daily usage.

In terms of performance, it's pretty good. The AMD 5600H performs pretty well for most tasks. The system could definitely use a RAM upgrade - it uses basically 50% with nothing open. Just opening Chrome takes it to 70% RAM usage, so watch those tabs. I don't consider the 8GB RAM too much of a limitation though since you can pick up 16GB DDR4 3200Mhz CL 22 sticks fairly cheap and it's an easy swap. I get about 6-7 hours of battery life with screen brightness around 70% and just doing mostly web/document work. Fan is pretty silent during usage like that but will ramp up decently wooshy if any sort of heavy app or game is opened. Battery gets quite warm while charging - my cat loves that.

Storage is fast with the m.2 drive and there's a good amount of space. OS/default apps take up a bit over 40GB of the 475GB available space. I've uninstalled McAfee and the O365 apps but otherwise it's fairly bloatfree for a clean start. I kept the MyASUS app for now, seems like it controls some fan profiles but I haven't played with it too much.

The 1920x1200 screen resolution is quite nice for web/documents since it has a bit of extra vertical space vs a regular 16:9 screen. The screen quality is just OK, nothing amazing. It's definitely not the OLED screen the other Vivobook models have, but it's fine.

Build quality is also decent. It's mostly plastic construction but feels solid and there's no creaking. The blue color is actually more subdued than I thought it'd be, it's darker but quite nice. It does show fingerprints easily unfortunately.

Other random notes:
- Wish it had USB-C charger. It does have one USB 3.2 Type C port that can be used for charging, but just one. The charger that comes with this system is a DC jack type, so it's just something else to buy.
- Speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop. On a table or hard surface it's great. I sometimes use this for streaming videos in tablet mode and they work well get loud if you need them to be.
- Touchpad is responsive and large. I do like the numpad feature, it's more useful than I thought.
- Power button being the fingerprint scanner is a nice feature and works well. It's slightly lower than other keys too so you don't accidentally press it.
- Tablet mode works well and it does disable keyboard when flipped around so that's good. It does not come with a stylus so you'll need your own.
- Keyboard is pretty nice to type on. I usually don't like laptop keyboards either.

So in short, this is a no-frills but reasonable laptop. I'd say it'd make a pretty good daily driver for most tasks. It's not too unique but it does offer some good performance in it's class compared to others."," September 7, 2022",5.0
,"The Asus Vivobook S14 Flip is a versatile laptop/tablet that's great for work on the go or at home, projects, bookkeeping, watching media, and video meetings. The Ryzen 5600H is a great mobile CPU and matches well with the 3200MT/s RAM. Unfortunately this model only comes with 8gb of RAM installed out of the box, which is basically bare minimum for a modern PC. I plan to install another 8gb. These are pretty great specs for a non-gaming notebook is this price range.

Performance: This machine boots in mere seconds and is very snappy when opening apps and doing basic tasks. The combination of the 6 core 12 thread Ryzen CPU with Fast RAM that is right in the sweet spot to get the most out of the processor and the fast NVMe SSD work together very well to eliminate system bottlenecks.

Display: Very nice considering this is not the OLED model. Good color, good brightness, and even pretty decent blacks. Unfortunately it's only 60hz so don't expect to do high end or competitive gaming on this. The touchscreen works great and is very responsive. It can quickly change orientations to portrait mode if you flip the screen to use it as a tablet.

Build quality: Very solid! The keyboard/base of the notebook has good structural rigidity, very little deck flex. The hinge has just the right amount of resistance to keep the screen where you want and keeps everything in place in the tent mode orientation. It feels like it will hold up for a long time.

Bloatware: This is a very clean machine other than having the dreaded McAfee preinstalled. Another reason Asus is superior to manufacturer like Dell and HP who preload all kinds useless apps to run in the background and waste resources.

Audio: It has impressively wide spatial sound. It's a bit lacking in bass, naturally but it's great sound at this price point.

Webcam: Provides a good picture even in fairly low lighting.

Trackpad: Silky smooth as advertised. Supports a range a gestures that are listed in the full manual you can download from the ASUS website. The Numpad functionality is very handy when working with spreadsheets or doing calculations. I should note that my Numpad button was locked by default, so I had to unlock it in the MyASUS app to be able to switch between trackpad and numpad.

BIOS: Most of you will never venture into the BIOS, but for power users/techheads there's not much to find there. The UI looks slick, but there's basically no useful options in there other than changing boot order if you need to boot from a flash drive or the Flash utility that you can use to update the BIOS.

One other thing to add is that the cooling system is very quiet and efficient. Even when running a stress test on the CPU I barely heard a whisper.

Overall. I feel like this device is great at this price point. I foresee using the Vivobook for years."," September 5, 2022",5.0
Just enough pep for the bucks,"I recently received the ASUS Vivobook S 14 Flip and have been extremely impressed with its performance. The laptop is well-equipped with a AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, providing fast and efficient performance for a variety of tasks. The 14"" WUXGA 16:10 touch screen is a nice touch, allowing for easy navigation and a high-quality display. The fingerprint sensor and NumberPad are convenient features, providing added security and making it easy to enter numbers.

One of the things I appreciate most about this laptop is its versatility. The flip design allows me to use it in multiple modes, including laptop, tent, stand, and tablet, making it perfect for a variety of situations. The laptop is also lightweight and portable, making it easy to take with me wherever I go.

The laptop is also well-made and holds up well to regular use. It has held up well over time and has remained in good condition.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the ASUS Vivobook S 14 Flip. It has proven to be a reliable and efficient tool for a variety of tasks, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a high-quality laptop. Five stars!"," December 31, 2022",5.0
,"I picked up this laptop as a replacement for a Chromebook. I was at the point where I wanted to install a few apps and possibly a game, if I can, beyond surfing the web and being limited to Google apps.

The hard drive is ample for what I wanted to install and I also plan to keep a few favorite movies on board. I went ahead and installed MS Office and my favorite game, World of Warships. This was a big test, as WoW requires a lot of memory and GPU. Although, I am not able to use all of the high-end graphics settings or even midlevel in-game, I am able to display a descent level of graphics and play without lag, after all things considered. I was not expecting the game to work as well as it did on 8 GB of RAM, but it passed! At some point I will upgrade the memory, but not a pressing need at the moment. Let me also, point out that it was more of a test to see if WoW would actually play on the laptop. If you are a diehard player, or gamer, the compromise in reduction of graphics display may be a bit too basic.

The ASUS Vivobook with the AMD Ryzen 5 processor produces nice graphics and really good sound for a laptop. The touchscreen display is very responsive to touch, no need to bear down. I like the ability to go from laptop to tablet with an actual Windows 11 OS. It is somewhat like the Microsoft Surface in a lot of ways, except more affordable. The fingerprint reader works well after setup in identifying only my fingerprint and rejecting other family members in my testing of that feature.

Vivobook's battery life is good. I can, in full laptop mode, squeak out five to six hours worth of usage.

Overall, I am very pleased with the Vivobook's performance and quality. It is upgradable in terms of memory and HD and for the price it is quite impressive!"," October 20, 2022",5.0
ASUS quality,"I'll start off with the first step anyone buying this laptop should take (mentioned in other reviews) is upgrade the RAM. Just adding a ~$25 8GB stick of RAM to this will make all the difference in its usability. The system works as delivered but really shines with that small upgrade. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was an available slot to add the stick without having to remove RAM from the system. Previous generations of this laptop required removing the old stick and buying a more expensive stick to upgrade the RAM.

The display has beautiful image quality and touch functionality which is a surprise at this price point.

The NVMe is fast and 512GB which is again amazing at this price point, you are usually looking at a slower drive with 256GB at this price.

The keyboard being backlit is a nice upgrade which many systems still don't include and the ASUS NumberPad in the track pad is a great feature for those that prefer using a number pad. Also, a fingerprint reader is included for quicker logins.

The touchpad is something that needs its own attention. I have a couple of other Asus laptops (both much more expensive) and the touchpads are standard like any other laptop I have used. I find them to be okay to use but much prefer a mouse but this one is very different it really is smoother than any other I have used and just works perfectly. My first reaction was an immediate liking of the smooth feel and loving the responsiveness, I never thought I would find a touchpad that I would consider using in place of a mouse until now."," September 23, 2022",5.0
,"It only seems appropriate that I am writing this review on the laptop. I really love this thing. I purchased myself a very expensive laptop just a few years ago. It is big, and it was supposed to have the 360 hinge, but when it arrived it did not. I almost returned it then but didn't want to go through the hassle. It's a great laptop, but it is big and heavy (comparatively), which is perfect when I have to buckle down and focus on work. But when I need something on the go or just want to do something while chilling, it is too much.
So when I saw this I was super excited. It loads up super fast, actually recognizes my fingerprint (most things won't) and has a good battery life. Touch screen is nice and sensitive. I will mostly be using it for basic internet, streaming movies, and maybe a little gaming. The graphic quality is great as is the sound for the size. And the 360 is a MUST if you have cats (hello being able to stream a movie without the cats walking over the keyboard and turning it off!!).
I haven't tried any video editing on it yet, but I will be soon and am hopeful it will be up to the task. I think the only thing I'd really like would be one more USB port, but I'll just have to dig out my hub when I get to that point.
Bonus, it came with a bunch of stickers you can decorate it with. Not my thing personally, but a super cute idea."," September 7, 2022",5.0
great for home use,This is a nice laptop with alot of power as well as lightweight. The 14 inch touch screen is nice and responsive. Love your able to flip it into a tablet. The apps are easy to use and set up. The keyboard is smooth and easy to use. I like the security with the fingerprint option in addition to the standard security. The colors on the screen are super rich. I definitely recommend this window laptop.," September 11, 2022",5.0
,"Update/Edit: I upgraded the ram to test if gaming performance improves. More found in the gaming part of my review. I also added section notation and titles.

-Starting Notes:

This is a great lap/tablet top. It is an interesting category as it is both a tablet and a laptop, with emphasis to laptop in design. There is some real attention to detail here as well, like pushing the power button behind the DEL button to prevent accidental shut downs, that still occurred in my testing mind you, which really does help. I am actually more excited now than before I got it.

One thing I wish they included was the stylus that the screen supports and that is one caveat.

-Display Quality:

Speaking of screens, for this price range I found zero options that look as good as this screen. Moreover, the next best ones I found were screens associated with Dell XPS and Apple laptops. This is an incredibly adept screen with amazingly vivid colors. It does not come with a high refresh rate panel, stuck at 60hz, but I doubt that will be an issue as the Vivo Flip does not do great on synthetic game tests, more on the tests later though. This is a 8 bit color screen and that isn't bad with how awesome it looks. You may be able to get more colors with a 10 bit, but even my XP Pen 22 artist 2nd gen is a 8 bit screen. Colors look better on the vivo, but I feel like there is a bit of an issue with accuracy. The accuracy isn't bad, but I can see that. Overall, do not fault the color here as it is very good. I also have a Dell Inspiron around this price range, as well as two Acer laptops, and all of those screens look like garbage in comparison. (All three of them are good laptops in many ways though, but screen quality is noticeably worse.)

-Number Pad:

Something I love, and is a different display type I suppose, is that this comes with a number pad. It is a non-traditional number pad, but it is included! I rejoice to find a formfactor of this caliber and it also includes a number pad. You will find the number pad on the touchpad, an icon that looks like a calculator/number pad design is found in the upper right corner. You press and hold that until the trackpad lights up to reveal the numbers. You can adjust the trackpad's light by pressing and holding the triangle with circles in the corners which are on the upper left side. There are only two brightnesses for the number pad. I am very happy with this design.

-USB-C Charge Notes:

Another thing I am happy for, but wish for an improvement, is that you can charge this via USB-C. I am running it on the same dock as my Dell XPS, and even my Acer Swift-X works on it. The thing is, I feel like they could improve this as they have a built in proprietary plug that comes with this. It is a lost opportunity here in that another USB port of some kind could have been installed in that spot. My Swift X from Acer suffers from this as well but the Intel version of the Swift X fixes that issue

-Build Quality:

Build quality is great overall. The main body is mostly plastic from what I can see, but when close, the thick aluminum shell of the screen does a great job offering rigidity. That rigidity helps during transportation as well as when the computer is being used in tablet form factor. That rigidity is really good. Overall, I am also impressed with the weight, obviously heavier than a tablet, where this is lighter than a normal laptop, even though it feels better than my Dell XPS.

-Sound Quality:

Sound quality here is actually amazing for the class, but there is a caveat. This system is designed to reflect sound off of a surface. It especially sounds good on my butcher block top desk. The issue is, I have it installed on a arm when at my desk, for multitasking work and fun. On the stand, it had nothing to bounce off of and it didn't offer a great first impression. Once on the table, it was night and day difference though and I recommend wood. I tested other surfaces as well. Including my lap, carpet, (which are bad ideas for heat) as well as my really standard kitchen countertop and plastic of my family's picnic table in the back. Wood sounded best, and the thicker/sturdier it was the better it sounded. I feel like it really does a great job competing with the sound my my Dell XPS 9300 which I found most laptops fail against. (Apple being the exception for sound quality comparison where it is close but Apple's seems to focus on a weird sound curve so I like my Dell better than what I tested from Apple.)

-Gaming:

I don't think you will be gaming on this. You can do some games like web games and not very intensive 2D games for example. This is where the Swift X has the Asus Vivo Flip beat, well one of the things. When I tested this with Time Spy, it was a dismal 749 score. I would say this is not a good computer to play games on because of this. Part of the issue is likely due to a lack of ram, where I will touch up on that subject soon. However, because of the performance this is more for productivity and movies/music. I can also see this used in art, but I would recommend an upgrade of the ram.

-Edit/Addition: Gaming reference:

I can say a 8GB ram upgrade does improve from the original 749 3DMark Time Spy synthetic test, it is still not exactly what I would call a gaming computer, just improving performance enough to get by in some games at low setting, with an improved score of 1294 which is 43% improvement. The extra ram did improve the CPU score as well, from 4127 to 5825 which I originally neglected to point out was close to the desktop Ryzen 5 3600x.

-Ram Upgrade:

Speaking of ram, it is upgradable... sort of. Opening this shell up requires finesse. There are 10 screws in the bottom, which I used a #0 Phillips bit. When you get all the screws out, you need to use a guitar pick to shimmy open the bottom of the case. There are loads of clips that I am afraid could break and starting from the back of the computer, where the computer vents heat, you work along the edge to pop out the clips. (Pressing inward and up while the pick is in there will release the back easily, but you have to experiment around the sides and front.) When you get the bottom casing off, you will not notice an easily accessible location for ram, but there is a large metal box. Under the box, which you can pop up with the pick used earlier, you will find the sodimm slot for ram. When you replace the ram, you can put the box back over the top, it is grounded for EMI (electromagnetic interference) related reasons I feel. However, you need to be careful to install it correctly and that all parts of the box should be on the inside of the tiny metal pegs which hold it in place as well and encircle the sodimm ram slot. (I think en-rectangle should be a word as it describes the shape better.) The bottom casing we took off earlier can be reinstalled and will also keep the box from popping off or coming loose. Remember that the center screw is the only screw that is larger in length than the rest.

-Additional note/Edit:

When upgrading ram, you will want Sodimm (laptop) memory, at DDR4 3200Mhz with CL 22 (cas latency.) If you match it up properly, you will see fewer issues with compatibility as well as the original 3200mhz speed for ram inside this. You can install any ""Sodimm DDR4 3200 CL22"" memory size from 4GB to I suspect 32GB. Having more ram allows for more programs, more tabs, or more elaborate art.

-Final Thoughts:

I actually love this computer, and I noticed that I switched from calling it laptop. It offers more functionality than your typical laptop, is really good with productivity, more portable, great sound, amazing display, includes a number pad in the trackpad, and I can only fault it for having hard to get to ram access, gaming score, and not including the stylus. I would say this is a 5 star, and really is worth the money. I would suggest upgrading the ram, but it works well for everyday use without that upgrade. However, standard use and I saw it use up 73% of the included ram, so make sure you close your tabs in Chrome if you don't want to upgrade the memory.

Pros:

-Amazing screen quality
-Amazing sound quality while on a hard surface.
-Amazing productivity flexibility.
-Number pad at 14 inch laptop form factor!

Cons:
-Harder than average ram upgrade. (But it can be upgraded!)
-No included Stylus.
-Limited Ram at 8GB"," September 3, 2022",5.0

,"I needed a laptop for work/school. Mainly one that was portable and could run tougher programs. I bought this in place of my gaming laptop so that I could take it places without a charging block attached. This laptop performs just as well as my $800 gaming laptop, and is portable! I love being able to turn this into a tablet and watch videos or play music off of it. The speakers are pretty good, but once you go over 50/100 on it you start to hear some distortion. Crisp sound until then though. I wish it came with a pen, but I'll have to do my research to find my own. The light up num pad is also very nice to have. I found it's a little hard to use since you can't feel around where your hand is, but it's still a very cool feature! I went on YouTube and pulled up a video in 4k (2160p) and it looks flawless! The USB C port is also a nifty add on, but it won't charge nearly as fast as it would with the charger that came with it. I haven't tested the battery life too much, but I know the charging is incredibly fast when using the charger that came with it. Overall, well worth the money. Incredibly quick and has room for additional RAM. 9/10 only because the speaker distortion and the need for a pen."," October 29, 2022",5.0
Awesome portable laptop,"Muy bonita laptop, la pantalla se ve muy bien y se siente bien La batería dura bien, nada extraordinario pero buen batería y carga rápido. Además, la propia computadora a través de MyAsus cuenta con un modo de protección de pila que limita su carga al 80% de su capacidad para proteger a la misma y que dure más, de todas formas recuerda no dejarla conectada por mucho tiempo. Es relativamente ligera, fácil de transportar y se siente premium, el cuerpo es mayoritariamente de plástico pero parece ser que la pantalla cuenta con cuerpo de aluminio, lo que le da buena apariencia. El rendimiento es bueno, me permite buenas multitareas sin bugeo. Aún no la pruebo para juegos pero actualizaré cuando tenga tiempo de probarlos. En cuanto al modo tableta y el touch, los gestos funcionan bien, pero a veces el touch puede fallar un poco, cómo que no se reconoce o se reconoce de manera espontána sin toque, sin embargo me he dado cuenta que esto solo pasa en Youtube pantalla completa. Además, hay sitios web y algunas aplicaciones que no están bien optimizadas para el touch. Ej. la página de la NFL no admite entrada táctil, o Adobe que si aceptada entrada táctil pero se siente mal optimizada y poco fluida. En cuanto a los programas de Office el touch funciona completamente normal, igual en sitios como YouTube (salvó por el comentario anterior), Crunchyroll, Netflix, Star, Dinsey+, pero a veces se puede sentir un poco la falta de optimización. Cuenta con teclado retroiluminado y el panel táctil del mouse tiene un botón para activar un teclado numérico bastante útil. El desbloqueo con huella no es la gran cosa, traté de configurar mi huella pero el lector no funciona de manera muy adecuada, la desbloqueo de manera convencional, es más rápido. El nivel de brillo no es la gran cosa pero se ve muy bien en interiores, no así, los reflejos aumentan con la iluminación ambiental y claro en exteriores. De igual manera la pantalla se ve muy bien y ya me la han chuleado. Aún no he modificado nada, pero parece ser que cuenta con una ranura extra para memoria RAM. La cámara cuenta con bloqueo físico. Viene con teclado extranjero, no cuenta con Ñ pero se puede configurar el teclado a LATAM, solo que las teclas no van a corresponder con los carácteres especiales (no letras), aunque puede ser tantito molesto solo es acostumbrarse. El cuerpo se ve un poco más grueso de lo que esperaba, pero igual es delgada y se ve elegante. Las bisagras se sienten firmes y resistentes y permiten varios ángulos.

Lo malo, las bocinas no están tan buenas a pesar de ser Hardman Kardon, al principio se escuchaban bien y no les daba un uso excesivo, pero cuando las usaba si lo hacía con el volumen algo alto, así que cuidado con eso porque dos semanas bastó para que las bocinas ""reventaran"" y ahora si se escuchan pero con algo de estática. EDIT Parece ser que el problema de las bocinas tenía que ver con la BIOS, para que el sistema funcione bien la BIOS debe estar debidamente actualizada. Así lo hice y tras la actualización las bocinas volvieron a funcionar de manera normal, si se escuchan muy bien pero nada extraordinario. Sin embargo, apartir de esta experiencia me he enterado que la laptop no cuenta con forma de hacer válida la garantía ya que es producto de E.U.A y las políticas de la Asus en México con cubren garantías de productos que no hayan sido exportados por Asus México. Así que mi laptop funciona normal y es excelente para uso diario multimedia y productividad, pero no tiene respaldo de garantía. Si hubiera algún otro mal aspecto sobre estás laptop, mencionaria el hecho de tener que limpiar la pantalla con frecuencia pues me encanta usar el touch.

En general una excelente compra, no me arrepiento pero probablemente adquirir un seguro para la misma no sería mala idea en caso de accidentes."," November 16, 2022",5.0
,"SUMMARY
A surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn't get the attention it deserves.

LEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE
Having recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021. I didn't need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.

The 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks. A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those ""laptop-y"" things... and an 11"" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.

PRIME DAY HUNTING
With those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook. I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago. A few other ""deals"" weren't any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).

I ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).

I watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review. In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.

UNBOXING AND USE
When the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook. I don't have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook). No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.

The lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.

The screen is a matte screen... yes! I've always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn't a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.

The keyboard isn't the same as that found on Lenovo's other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.

The trackpad works well and is consistent.

Battery life is extremely good. I haven't run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I've run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours. I don't know how true that is, but I'll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.

Performance is more than adequate. The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.

Because expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit. It's nothing personal against them, it's how we're all wired. That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.

Lenovo has been ""killing it"" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space. Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.

I've owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were. I'm baffled as to why expert reviewers haven't given this device more attention.

I was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.

I'm delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks. I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3."," June 26, 2021",4.0
A Hidden Gem Among the Bargain Chromebooks,"I am so happy I bought this!!! It is intuitive, fast, and a joy to work on. Even typing this review right now is fun. I love the size, the durability, the keyboard. Being a Chromebook, there are a couple of shortcut keys that make working so much more efficient. And the fact that it seamlessly works with my other devices is a boon. And the price is amazing! Definitely worth it."," June 30, 2023",4.0
,"This is a 5 star chrome book for basic use but is lacking in some areas which bring the overall value of it down. The screen is fine for basic web browsing and document editing but is lacking in brightness, so stay inside or find a shady place to work when on the go.

Speakers are dull but present and fine for watching YouTube videos or when paired with the average webcam, fine for video calls.

The build quality is okay for most people but the plastic shell might warrant a protective sleeve for those that plan to toss this in a backpack."," May 23, 2023",4.0

The dates given in the answers provided by Lenovo representatives to questions about when updates will stop vary from 2026 to 2028. However, the actual date appears to be 2025. Here are the answers given to this question that Amazon provides:

Q: Which chromebook version & chrome os version is this?
A: This is the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11 Chromebook, model number 82BA0003US - IdeaPad 3 CB 11IGL05. It ships with the Chrome Operating System that will automatically update to the latest version of the Chrome OS upon connection to the internet, through June 2027.
By Lenovo Representative in the United States on October 4, 2022

Does the Lenovo product being sold here actually have the serial number 82BA0003US? I could not find it on the package of the Chromebook I received. Or do these answers refer to a different Lenovo model?

The problem may arise because some of the information on the Amazon page suggests that the Lenovo 100e Chromebook being sold here has an MT8173 processor, while other information on the page gives the processor as an MT8183, a more recent model. When I ordered several of these Chromebooks, the models I received had MT8173 processors, and were identified with the model name 81QB. This version appears to have a June 2025 Google support expiration date.

When Google support will expire is a critical piece of information for purchasers of the Lenovo 100e, and this site on Amazon provides answers that are inconsistent and very likely misleading. While the product is priced competitively, the information given on the website should be clear and accurate."," June 24, 2023",4.0
,"I am pleased with the chromebook. It arrived a day earlier than promised which was nice. But the item description said that it had 64 GB of storage. The unit I received only has 32 GB. Not a real deal breaker considering the price I got it for plus it will also take a micro sd card for additional storage. But I chose this one because of the additional storage and was disappointed to find that it came with less than what was advertised. With that being said, it is a nice little chromebook. This is my first experience using a chromebook so I spent quite a bit of time learning about it. I bought it because I sit on several boards and wanted something a little smaller than my laptop for note taking. I was able to download the WPS Office Lite app which allows me to work on my documents offline with no difficulty. It will also take a micro sd card which allows me to store my documents there instead of on the internal storage space. It comes with two usb-c and two usb-A ports that allow me to use the files on my usb devices. The processor is quite fast and the battery life is very good. I probably used it for a total of six hours and it was only down to 40%. So that is a big plus. If a chromebook is what you are looking for, I would highly recommend this Lenovo Chromebook. I only wish the seller had posted the correct information in the product description. This is the item description that was on Amazon: Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11 Chromebook Laptop,11.6"" HD Display, Intel Celeron N4020, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, UHD Graphics 600, Chrome OS, Onyx Black."," February 20, 2023",4.0
Browsing and basic use machine,I bought this for something easily portable to take on vacation that wasn't going to break the bank. I pretty much use all the Google apps so a Chromebook works for me. It is not the fastest or best screen resolution but for the price this was very good to take on vacation to just check email or get online.

Accurate information should be provided with respect to the Google support expiration date,"This is a cheap laptop, which is exactly why I bought it. I use it when I travel for work since it's really lightweight, and by running linux on it I can do anything I would need it to.

The screen is blurry, and it can sometimes do a weird thing where it doesn't turn on while outside, but it gets the job done and is no frills. The built in chrome os has major training wheels but that may be desirable for some users.

A note on running linux on this: your best bet is using Crouton to set up a chroot. This chromebook has a Gemini Lake processor, so trying to do anything more fancy like a dualboot or replacing the chromeos completely with linux or windows doesn't really work sadly.

If you decide to go ahead with the chroot, my advice is to use a simple desktop like xfce if you run ubuntu. I tried to get unity working and you may have better luck (or skills xD) than me, but when I tried booting the initial setup never ran, and doing tricks like opening the terminal via a shortcut just didn't work.

Nice Little Chromebook,"This is my first Chromebook, and I've been using it for two days. The battery life is amazing so far; it does appear to be 10 hours. Reading the reviews, it seems like a wide range of experiences, and I feel fortunate that mine works well so far.

It was very easy to set up. I saw 11.5 in the description, but the actual display screen is 10 inches. It isn't a touch screen, and the keys are dark gray, not black. This was an impulse purchase after getting a new laptop a few days ago. My 6 year old Dell would work no longer, and I got an expensive gaming laptop. It was my second one, but I was not expecting it to get so hot, with a noisy fan. The battery life is about an hour. To feel more comfortable, I wanted a Chromebook for email, YouTube, and Amazon videos. So, this is doing what I want it to.
I will likely get more used to having no delete key, instead the alt+backspace key is used for that function. I was surprised when my bookmark bar appeared with bookmarks from 2013 on. I've deleted many of them in the bookmark manager.
My main dissatisfaction is the disappearing vertical scroll bar. In some emails, you can select ""view in
browser"". I would be more frustrated if I didn't have the laptop available. There might be a fix for that; I haven't researched yet.
I purchased mine when it was 52% off, which is worth it. Buying electronics is risky. I've been very disappointed in the past, which is why I'm relieved and accepting of the machine I got.
Almost everything has become more expensive, and reasonable expectations seem to be in order. With two days use, I'm not regretting my purchase."," September 14, 2022",4.0

Recommended for high school students or college students who don’t need anything fancy."," March 30, 2023",4.0
What's Not To Like,"This Chromebook is dirt cheap and would be great for a student on a budget or someone who just needs to use a few apps and browse the internet. I use it as a writing laptop, as I don't want to take my expensive, bulky gaming laptop all over the place.

Despite being plastic, it does seem to be solid. The matte finish is a fingerprint magnet, though it's not a big deal. The battery life is good, and as far as Chromebook keyboards go, it's fine to type on and better than some I have encountered in the past.

It's fast enough, though it's not zippy and will struggle with heavy apps or opening too many at once. The screen is also not exactly beautiful and looks very dated. Still, do you really need a nice screen on a $100 Chromebook? You also need to be aware that Chromebooks basically have an update expiration date, so before you think you're getting a sweet deal on one, be sure to look up when it will stop receiving updates. I believe this one is good until 2026 or 2027, which is enough time to get enough bang for your buck.

If you're aware of this Chromebook's limitations, this may be a nice buy. It suits my needs, and honestly I can't stomach the idea of paying much for a Chromebook in the first place. I won't feel sick if it gets lost or stolen while I lug it around, but it does what I need it to do well enough."," October 2, 2022",4.0
,"Day one, and the Ideapad 3 started right up. I'm going to let it charge for a while before I complete the setup. One star deducted for no English setup instructions in the box.

Day 3. Just discovered it isn't a touch screen. No biggie, I hate touch screens anyway. I'm using a small wireless mouse, and it works fine. I'm not sure how much internal memory this unit has, but I just stuck a 64 gb sd card in it so that'll be fine.

I bought this for a specific meeting - to see if I could drive a presentation on a large screen tv without having to bring a full featured laptop or tablet and to see if I'd like a Chromebook better than a tablet. Today, I hooked this little Lenovo Chromebook up to a big screen via the usb c port and it works fine. Had to buy the special cable with the HDMI on the other end but it was inexpensive and it came the next day from Amazon. What I really like about this little gem (if it continues to work...) is that it has regular usb ports as well - 2 of them! My Lenovo M10 tablet has none and thus there's no way to input or output data via cable. This is proving to be an interesting experiment."," October 14, 2022",4.0

,"I got this computer for work. I needed something cheap and highly portable, and having used a chromebook in school I knew I wanted one. This chromebook is great for the price and needs I needed met. ChromeOS is a pretty smooth and well rounded system, and this particular laptop is sleek, thin, lightweight, and visually pleasing. It does have Linux built in, but I can't comment on that because I'm not the most tech savvy. The good thing about chromebooks is you don't really have to be.

Keep in mind if you want a chromebook, most of the time the apps are meant for a phone or tablet. As far as I know, most games won't work or will be hard to play, and some apps have diminished usage because of how tapping vs. Clicking works. Not that big of a deal to me, but it could be frustrating to someone who wants a regular laptop for casual use.

The touchpad on this particular one is pretty good, and large enough to use given the size of the laptop. The keys are a little thin and small so sometimes I miss them or mistype when going fast. The screen is perfectly acceptable, vibrant and it fills most of the bezel. Overall, 8/10."," November 19, 2022",4.0

I've tried so many fixes that should work including Powerwashing it, shutting down /restarting my router to reset, shutting down my Chromebook, checking for updates and drivers, which there aren't. Sorry, but this is a bust. I preferred my Kindle Fire. My spouse is upset too and wishes she gave me something else. Who would have thought this would be junk? NO SUPPORT FROM LENOVO AT ALL!!!!!

Original review Feb 02, 23: My spouse gave me this as a gift to replace my seven year old Kindle Fire which started freezing up. (She gave me that too!) First off, this is not so easy to set up. Especially when you're dealing with light service internet by AT&T. I can get on it as guest but I am not able to become the Chromebook's owner. Can't figure out how to set that up. Also, had to contact Lenovo to correct the purchase date. They had it down for October which shortened my warranty. Make sure you catch that.
Looks nice. Very lightweight item. Works fine other than initial setup. We'll see how this works as time goes by. Attractive and overall easy to operate. Slim lined in operation. Aside from connection woes, I like it and highly recommend it.

the red powering light shows up now and crosh terminal : ""battery_test 8"" show that battery is ( charging or full) 100%. so does chrome://power

Some people on youtube claim its a static electric problem that chromebooks have. To bad they dont come with simple to remove and replace batteries like old laptops use to have.

+ ribon unplugged and replugged then back together.
+ everything works now. but if i have to do that every couple of month im going back to my old 2011 acer laptop that has linux on it.

So just a warning for people that dont like to have to take things apart to fix them. dont get this lenovo chromebook.

do a youtube search for ""chrome book battery is not charging"" and you see that its a common problem.
Some people blame the ChromeOS and fix the problem by doing a hard reset that wipes all the data and make you start over from scratch. That was not a option i felt like doing.

My lenovo idea pad 3 11 chromebook 11.6"" laptop. it is the one with the intel celerin N4020 chip. i got the intel one for the linux support.

at the time if purchase in june-2021 $169. -$208 after tax.
Well i thought it would last longer without running into problems.

no touchscreen on mine. i don't know if the touchscreen and ARM based ones are build better. they cost $30 or $40 dollars more. I have never had this kind of battery trouble with android tablets. maybe its just a chromebook laptop thing.

Becuase i was able to get the battery working again i will give this laptop a 1½ star or TWO star review.

If it worked right without battery trouble i would have given it a solid FOUR out of FIVE stars. I like the running firefox from the linux virtual machine. i also use the linux side of the chromebook for podcast. andriod support is just a little meh, but i use the netflixs android app to download show for later and it work good enough.

The screen can be seen in about any lighting condition, direct sunlight is a little sketchy but still usable. The battery life (for me) is about 2 weeks, really depends on what I'm doing though. If I'm really using it for work and then come home to mess around on the internet I'll get about 10 hours sometimes 11 hours but that's really pushing it. The screen size is pretty nice it's only 11 inches but for what I really do on it I don't mind, if I need to do more I usually get on my 17 inch but for timesheets and excel this little thing is nice. Performance side of things this thing runs great, 99% of apps open in seconds. For the money this is a fantastic machine, perfect size for on the go, responds instantly, and lives all day or more in my case. The only thing I would say I don't like is that only 1 of the 2 USB C ports will charge it, would be nice if it would work either way."," May 3, 2022",5.0

Serves my purpose,"I like having a convenient Chromebook for searching, streaming videos, answering emails, and performing everyday tasks, which gives my bigger laptop (with Windows, Word, and other programs) a rest. I had a trusty Samsung Chromebook but it just reached its support expiration date. I was amazed to pay less for this Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11 than I did for that old Samsung, especially since it's also clearly better: more light-weight, more portable (but same screen size), and very noticeably faster, with a superior keyboard and touchpad. I was thinking of getting another Samsung, but the one in a comparable price range did not have a micro SanDisk slot, which my old Samsung did have and which I find very useful, since I download a lot of files in the course of a month. That was the decisive factor for me. The only thing I regret is not looking around for an even *better* price, which I discovered I could have had from BestBuy. But I still think the price is incredible, especially with hyper-inflation. Strongly recommended, so long as you don't mind an 11.6"" screen. But shop around.... :-)"," June 10, 2022",5.0
,Purchased for the purpose of organizing household finances in one place. The computer was decent. It did not have touch screen---somehow the product description made me think it did. Start-up was quick. My issue is because it did not have the Windows operating system it was not compatible with some software I needed to install. Did not come with Microsoft office either. I would need to use the subscription I had via a browser instead of opening on the desktop which I also was not a fan of. I did like that it was compact and small enough to fit in a large purse and charging time was decent. Comparable to a more expensive Chromebook I purchased for my daughter for school just less memory. Good laptop overall for the price just did not meet my need.," April 13, 2022",5.0
Fantastic for the price,"The worst purchase I ever made on amazon.
A customer support supervisor, told me theres nothign they can do and HUNG UP on me
on aug. 23rd at 10 am. absolutely abhorent the treatment i got from amazon.
Never again will i purchase electronics from amazon.
The first day I received this laptop the bottom plastic grip came off.
The laptop system started giving me problmes, no wifi.
All you will ever hear from tech support is “powerwash” That's all you can do to fix a chromebook.
2.5 months later after several power washers. The laptop broke down completley.
Amazon told me that because it was past the 30 days i could not return it and that i had to deal with lenovo.
Lenovo was a nightmare, you will call a call center overseas.
They told me I had to send it for repairs if a powerwash did not fix the issue.
I had to pay to ship it myself to the repair center.
It took 1.5 weeks to repair it and they never told me nor wrote in the repair order what was fixed on the laptop. I still do not know to this day what was repaired.
Lenovo sent it to the wrong address, 1 hour away from me. That in itself was another nightmare.
I had to go to the wrong address and luckily was able to retrieve it.
The issue was repaired but they left the screen loose now it opens loosely to the left and I know this will be an issue later.
Lenovo did not glue the non-slip grip on the back and mailed it to me with it off.
The screen now flickers and they are glitches.
I was told by lenovo to buy more warranty.
Why would I pay $80 dollars for extended warranty when I paid $200 dollars for a new laptop.
The laptop should ""work"" period.
In all the drama and stress of dealing with this issue and mailing it my backpack was stolen.
That in itself was a grief I did not need.
Bottom line it's a lemon, but I'm old and simply don't want to deal with amazon or lenovo anymore.
My fault lessons learned the only reason i had to buy another laptop was because the samsung was going to expire. That's something I did not know about chromebook they expire after 5 years.
In conclusion, I regret buying a lenovo chromebook.

Update: the chromebook Broke down again. That's twice in less than 3.5 months. The same issue No Wi-Fi, glitches in the system, the screen flickers, screen goes white then shutsdown. Sent it in and again I had to pay the shipping and packaging. I have made up my mind that when I get it back,I am simply getting rid of it and buying a chromebook from best buy.

- No tiene ventilador así que no suena
- Buenos parlantes

- La pantalla es horrible. No es por la resolución, es el panel en sí que es malito. Si eres exigente con la pantalla, NO la compres
- El trackpad aunque funciona, se nota que fue otro lugar donde cortaron presupuesto. Es poco preciso pero igual cumple
- No sé si fue mi compu específicamente o será en todas, pero hay un ruido electrónico que en ambientes muy silenciosos se nota.

,"I have only had this laptop for about a month. Overall, I really like it so far and have had no trouble transitioning from Windows 10 to Windows 11, although I don't give this machine a lot of tasks; it's my travel computer and my bedside companion.

I did have a concern about the battery charging, though, and I want to alert people to the issue. If you don't want to read this review any further, just please remember to keep the Lenovo Vantage software on your computer in case you need it.

First, the laptop ships with a charger that is a small brick with a cable that has a three-prong wall plug and another cable that connects to the USB-C port on the laptop. I used the charger and the battery charged up to 100% with no problems. I had my battery set to ""Battery Saver"" in the Windows 11 system settings.

The laptop does have the older type of round charging port, but you have to buy a separate charger to use it. So that's what I did; I went to the Lenovo site and bought that charger---which by the way, is not too lightweight itself, but at least it's more manageable for use on trains and such, and it has the two-prong wall plug.

So last night, I decided I had better make sure the additional (travel) charger worked okay. I noticed, though, that my battery was only charging up to 60% of capacity. The charger was powering the machine, but the battery wasn't filling up. I thought maybe the charger was defective. At that point I switched to the charger that came with the laptop, but with that charger, also, the battery wasn't charging beyond 60%! Oh, no! At that point, I thought my laptop must be a lemon. I downloaded an additional software from the Lenovo site, Lenovo Diagnostic Tool, and ran a test on the battery. The battery test failed!

I remembered that another Amazon customer who had reviewed this laptop had complained that he couldn't charge his battery beyond 60%. A Lenovo representative responded something about a setting that prevented full loading of the battery to extend battery life if the laptop is kept plugged in. I looked for that setting in the Windows battery settings, and changed my Power Mode setting to Best Performance, but that didn't help. I could find nowhere in the Windows Settings to get the battery to charge more fully.

Eventually, I looked in the Lenovo Vantage software, under More Settings, and found that my machine had been set (not be me, I swear) to Conservation Mode. This setting is only in the Lenovo Vantage software, and is NOT the same as Battery Saver in the Windows settings. Once I changed my laptop from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charger in Lenovo Vantage, my battery started charging again.

The purpose of Conservation Mode is to conserve the life of the battery if the laptop is continually kept plugged in. Because that's how I use the laptop, I will continue to use Conservation Mode, but will try to remember to switch to Rapid Charge mode if I want to take the laptop to another location without taking along a charger.

I suspected that the travel charger I purchased separately had somehow triggered the computer to convert from Conservation Mode to Rapid Charge, but that is not the case. If the computer is in Rapid Charge mode, either charger will charge the battery to 100%. If the battery has a charge of less than 60%, and the computer is in Conservation Mode, either charger will charge it to 60%. If the battery has a charge of between 60% and 100%, the computer is then put into Conservation Mode and plugged into either charger, the computer will be powered by the charger but the battery will not be further charged.

I hope this review is helpful."," May 28, 2022",4.0

,"With windows 11 being kinda fresh still, I’ve run into some software issues along the way. At the very start one of my drivers would not work for the audio and it scared me. Took a lot of trying but I finally got one to work after a few hours. Based on just the laptop itself, I like It. It has a sturdy build and I really like the keyboard. Happy I got the larger ram option too. I do have some complaints about the tablet mode but it really does provide me everything I need in a 2 in one.

Complaints. Sometimes it just overloads the computer and the pen starts cutting in and out. I use OneNote and it can get pretty glitchy while using in tablet mode. Tends to freeze or stop taking inputs correctly. Also, the output volume from the frontal speakers is not very loud. Also if you have it in your lap the fans start getting super loud and blowing hot air. Sometimes when it charges it starts revving the fan too and the noise can be a little embarrassing if you’re in public

Other than that very solid though"," February 16, 2023",4.0
good price for school,"I purchased the Ryzen 5 16gb/256gb variant.

I wish I had gotten the variant with more storage (1tb instead of 256gb)... although if I choose to upgrade, I can do it myself since theoretically the M.2 NVMe SSD is able to be replaced.

Came with laptop, 65w PD charger, and stylus with AAAA battery. I purchased two accessories (listed at end of review)

One USB C port: Supports PD charging up to 65w (charger included but you can use your own if it supports PD) and data transfer at 2.0 speeds.

Two USB A ports: both support 3.2 speed, one of them has constant power (intended for charging other devices when laptop is off).

One audio jack: headphones out and microphone in use the same port. Plugging in regular headphones is just as normal, no adapters needed.

The side mounted power button is hard to hit but you will rarely use it. Even after being shut down, it will turn back on when you open it.

Fingerprint reader is quick to recognize your fingerprint. Unlocking the computer after startup is extremely quick.

Touchpad is very responsive and features the same tricks we use on our phones (i.e. double tap, scrolling, ect.) For examples on the gestures you can use, search ""touchpad gestures"".

The screen is bright. Using it in a classroom, office, or outside in the shade is great. Direct sunlight is where it becomes hard to read.

The screen folds all the way back. You can use it in any position. Once folded, it will orient itself to the way you're holding it. Think of how your phone automatically changes it's orientation if you rotate it.

Webcam is decent. I love the privacy slide cover it has. With this I always know that the camera is covered.

Keyboard is normal. It's a laptop keyboard. Clicky but spongy.

Battery life is normal for a laptop of this size. Whatever the advertisement says is probably true. I've never tested it because I always have it plugged in.

GAMING: It can game. I have successfully played Valorant, Fortnite, and Minecraft. It can do it, but don't expect 1080p at 60fps unless you turn down the games performance.

Notes: I purchased these accessories:

1. A screen protector called: ""Spigen Tempered Glass ... (81X20005US)""

2. A case called: ""mCover case ... /5-14ALC05/""

3. And put clear tape over the palm rests."," August 1, 2022",4.0
,"I got this laptop for school since my campus is huge and I'm way more mobile than I thought I'd be. If you have to carry a lot of stuff, the laptop can be a little heavy on top of that. I'm a communication design major so I'm using Adobe all the time. While this laptop can run the suite, the battery will die in like 3 hours using one program. I use this to supplement the school computers. On regular use I get like 8 hours (very rough estimate. Its full at the start of the day and I still have like 20% by the end). I don't game a lot anymore but it can run Dead by Daylight. Granted it'll kill your battery in an hour and your fans will be on full blast. If its plugged in and on low detail you can still play lol. Carry your charger all the time just for convenience sake. Its bulky but do it.

I initially didn't care for the 2 in 1 feature but its pretty handy when I'm trying to show people something. The pen uses a AAAA battery which I didn't know was a thing. I don't use it a ton since I already have a Huion but works fine, the pen pressure is good. The keyboard is nice to type on. Lenovos keyboards are half of why I wanted this one, I hate mushy keys.

The glossy screen is a little annoying but you get used to it. If you absolutely can't stand it, there's matte screen protectors. The screen is also only like 250 knits so not great for use in the sun. It gets hot easily. Just updating something on Steam/Adobe will pump the fans on. Propping it up on something helps. If you have one of those laptop fan trays even better. The camera is not great but what laptop has a good one. The fuzzy ass photo is an example shot. For an average user (emails/ Netflix) this will be more than enough. If you're an artist on a budget its a good option."," June 15, 2022",4.0
Some issues but mostly solid,"I have had this a week. So far the laptop is good. Setup took a while between all the configuration settings I wanted and to download all the Windows updates. The one thing that bugs the you-know-what out of me is the pen. The instructions to set it up were worthless because it seems Lenovo has umpteen different versions of it, and of course the one packed with my Lenovo Flex 5 Ryzen 5000 was not listed. US1213 is stamped on the pen, but I can't find anything on that. What is it? A model number? A serial number? So I have no freakin clue how to use it. It would be nice to know, but it's not a deal breaker. Other then that, I'm satisfied at this point.

The keyboard is responsive and easy to use. The feel is solid as a chicklet keyboard. The touch screen functions as expected. The boot-up speed is fast. Fingerprint reader was super fast and easy to set up. My laptop shipped with a USB-C power connector, which was good. The built in privacy shutter is nice. The speakers have been maligned in previous comments, but for the money what can one realistically expect? This is a really good buy! You want better speakers? Lay out more money. Others have denigrated the laptop's plastic case, but again, for the money you get a darn good, solid case. People have said that it bends if you pick it up by the corners or lift the lid by the corners. Well, you're not supposed to do that anyway! If you treat it the way a manufacturer recommends, then follow the recommendations. Don't complain when you don't do what is recommended! For the record I did try to do those things and got NO bending at all. But then I only did it a few times to see if the comments were correct."," May 20, 2022",4.0
,"This is my 3rd Lenovo laptop and it does not disappoint! I’ve had it for about 2 months now and I am honestly very happy with my purchase. I am an engineer and a bit picky with my tech and considering the price, I don’t think you can find a better performing laptop for the price.

The Ryzen 5 5500U processor is blazing fast and the 16GB RAM is sufficient to handle multiple programs simultaneously without a problem. My model only has a 256GB SSD (this model was on a special for $599), but if you are using the cloud it is more than sufficient storage. I even run an Ubuntu dual boot with 60 GB allocated and the remaining storage on the Windows side is still plenty.

The touch screen and the stylus pen are significantly better than I expected. I’ve never had a touch screen laptop but I’m impressed with the responsiveness and the quality of the touch and draw features. I don’t use them very often though since I’m mostly writing software.

I do a lot of typing and I really like the keyboard (though I am not one of the picky software types with mechanical keyboards complaining about key travel distance and such).

I was aware of the low brightness screen (you won’t be able to work outside), the lack of display-over-USB-C capability (I just use the HDMI port) and the USB-C charger which eliminates the use of the USB-C port for other peripherals (I just use a small USB-C dock with extra ports), but I decided that for the price of the laptop, these are worth living with.

One thing that bothers me a little bit though is location of the power button. It is on the side of the laptop (on the right side), and I’ve pressed it accidentally a few times while adjusting the position of my laptop, which puts the laptop to sleep. Thanks to the SSD I can get it running again within a few seconds, but it is slightly annoying.

Overall I can highly recommend this laptop for someone that wants great performance at a low cost (but willing to live without certain nice-to-haves)."," May 15, 2022",4.0
Absolutely love it!,"****Please note there is an issue with Lenovos battery software that sometimes causes it to conflict with windows battery management drivers. You can uninstall the windows drivers and windows will automatically reinstall them when the computer is rebooted ergo why I have this 4 stars (since Lenovo still hasn’t addressed it)****

I got this laptop when it was on sale just ahead of Ryzen 6000 series chips coming out for a 25% discount. Lenovo is presumably looking to get rid of old stock. If you can get it for <600 bucks it’s a great value as of March 2022. Specs for the unit I bought were:

-Ryzen 5 5600U mobile APU (with onboard Vega graphics)
-256 GB M.2 SSD
-16 GB LPDDR4

Came with:

-12 month warranty with technician support
-USB-C Charger
-Stylus

For a laptop for my mom to browse the web and pay bills off of it kicks ass. It has a metal body with a nice finish that doesn’t attract noticible finger prints. It also came with their stylus which my mom loved just because it’s novel and she’s never had a laptop with that option. It is light, has excellent battery life, and makes for a great laptop for average productivity tasks and some very light gaming. It packs a punch and looks great doing it. The battery life in this is also fantastic. When doing normal workloads (I.e. just browsing the web, paying bills, etc) this thing will last literal days on one full charge. It also has a reasonable selection of IO with HDMI out, 2 USB 3.0 and 1 USB-C which is used for charging but can be used for other stuff. Overall, would recommend for now but as 6000 series laptops become more readily available you might want to start looking at those for RDNA 2.0 graphics if the price and specs are right. Don’t get intel they suck."," April 1, 2022",4.0
,"This is my second Lenovo Flex Laptop. My previous one was a 2015 Flex 3 Model.So, obviously I like Lenovo. I felt it was time for a new one. Its lighter than the old one and came with a pen. Works well. Working with Lenovo / Windows to fix a few issues-ie no Power Icon on Desktop-have to switch to Windows Start to turn off computer. I use the HDMI plug to connect to a monitor as I use more as a Desktop. Also have Keyboard and mouse.
The Amazon Description did not match the Specifications-One example was USBs are 3.1 and not 3.2. With no Ethernet plug I got an adapter for the ""C"" plug and that's where I plug in ethernet instead of using WIFI. I have a DC plug for Power. Only has 2 USB's and I use one for Keyboard/Mouse. When necessary I have a nice USB HUB (Inateck) that expands to 4. The Lighted Keyboard is only on the top row-It sort of spreads down to the rest of the keyboard. The old Flex 3 was totally lighted. Overall I am going to like this one-It has 16GB RAM vs 8 GB on th eold one."," August 22, 2022",4.0

,"I picked this up because I've been wanting a 2-in-1 to do some of my digital artwork on but also use as a laptop when I'm not using it for art.

The processor is fantastic and can handle anything I throw at it, including some light gaming. I'm a fan of the design and, while it's a little heavier than typical ultrabooks, it's not a huge weight as I take it with me through my day.

The two big drawbacks are the screen and the pen that came with it.

The screen doesn't have a huge color gamut so the colors aren't super accurate but, because I finish off the color work on my art on my desktop later on in my process, that's not a major problem for me. The bigger issue with the screen is the LOW max brightness. It tops out at 250 nits which means it's close to impossible to see outdoors on anything except for a completely overcast day but even just using it indoors basically requires you to keep it at max brightness to see clearly.

The digital pen that came with it was defective. I could use its passive features like basic drawing and interacting with the screen (just like you can with your finger because it's a touchscreen) but the pen wouldn't pair at all with the laptop or any of my other devices. I went through all the troubleshooting steps in the manual online and through every other troubleshooting info I could find after spending hours on Google searching for help. I made sure it wasn't a dead battery and that the laptop paired just fine with other bluetooth devices so, unfortunately, the pen was dead on arrival and the pen being included with the laptop was part of the value proposition of the device so where I would have given it four stars had the pen worked, I had to drop it down to three since that's $50 worth of defective product there.

The laptop itself would work well for anyone who would never have to use it outdoors or in direct sunlight indoors as long as you keep the brightness at maximum all the time.

Because of the low brightness and the defective pen, I have to give it three stars overall instead of the four it would have earned otherwise."," March 9, 2022",4.0
Great 2-In-1 for the Price But Defective Pen,"Just disable reflections. I am consistently impressed with this little thing on the gaming front.

You should also raise the throttle percentage in the power settings for the processor to get rid of some of the weird inexplicable stickyness stickyness. It actually is a pretty decent processor and for a small notebook like this it really is overall a pretty powerful little computer.

The screen leaves something to be desired.
It easily reflects even low light, and is hard to see during the day time if there is too much sunshine in your vicinity, to the point it's nearly unusable in certain lighting conditions."," February 4, 2023",4.0

Runs Skyrim on very high settings,"This is the second one of these I have purchased in two years. The first one was mine. This one was for my wife and she loves it!
Initial Setup:
Out of the box experience is standard Windows 10. During the setup process, you are asked if you want to upgrade to Windows 11. It was so easy that my wife did this without needing any help from her IT husband.
Ease of Use:
The included webcam and fingerprint reader makes for easy chatting with friends and quick sign-on without the need for password/pin. The embedded webcam is clear and works in varying lighting conditions. The webcam has a software ""kill"" switch but for those that don't trust software, there is a hardware slide cover to keep the webcam from being viewed without your consent.

Quizá en lo único que podría quejarme sería en que a veces falla el rechazo de palma de mano al momento de escribir, cosa que hace que se mueva la pantalla cuando se intenta tomar notas.

La duración de la batería es adecuada y obviamente depende del uso y los programas que se usen.

"USB C just for charging, stop charing after 3 month of light use, repaired with warranty service","Be warned that the network adapter that comes with this laptop is an absolute POS. I'm a software dev with 20 yrs experience, but don't take my word for it: Google ""lenovo qualcomm atheros"" for many, many users who have had and continue to have issues with it. It simply is not stable, no matter what driver you install (I tried them all).

It'll work fine when just browsing and whatnot, but as soon as you need to download a significant payload (e.g. a game), it'll disconnect and then no longer see any networks. I've confirmed ad nauseum that it's not the network itself because other devices have no issues under the same circumstances and continue to work when this machine goes down. I even downgraded to Window 10 in hopes that might help to no avail.

So if you're okay with deactivating the installed network adapter in favor of a cheap $40 wifi usb adapter, you'll probably like this machine. It does almost everything else well, loading apps and pages quickly, with a responsive touchscreen and pen, bright display and a, nice backlit keyboard. I have noticed that it struggles a little converting to tablet mode and back sometimes, forcing one to close the lid altogether to get it to complete changing modes."," July 4, 2022",4.0
,"The laptop works as expected. Performance and battery life is at par. I manage to work for 5-6 hours with full brightness and medium work load. I frequently work with 10+ tabs open with lot's of medium computation programming in parallel. The laptop pulls it off without a hick. Built quality is decent, the top panel could have used an extra screw around touchpad. Make sure you update the BIOS and Drivers. I faced some graphic hiccups before that. Consider Yoga series if you want a metal body and better screen.

Pros:
- Value for money if you manage to get it around 600 for Ryzen 5 & 16Gb. I did!
- Comes with the Pen (Double check the listing)
- Speakers are loud for a call, but not great for music
- Fingerprint reader is very responsive

Cons:
- Fingerprint does not wake up the computer from sleep
- No auto-brightness.
- RAM is not upgradable
- No space for 2.5"" HDD but you can swap the SSD
- Average Brightness
- Average Webcam
- The cooling fan tends to get loud as there isn't sufficient clearance between laptop and table.

That being said, none of this is a dealbreaker, and I would still recommend the product."," April 29, 2022",4.0

,"This is more of a 4.5 Star review rather than 5 complete stars.

Bought this laptop for my wife. She previously owned old MacBook Air 11'' and wanted something with slightly bigger screen. When we compared, because of Lenovo's thin bezels, sizes of these machines are almost same, Lenovo is slightly bigger but as the bezels are thin, laptop feels very compact.

Lenovo Flex 5 has a great design. Material feels premium, keyboard, touchpad, speakers are good (not great). Comes with Windows 11. Microsoft office is pre-installed but not activated so you have to pay for it. I didn't see it in the pictures but the screen fully rotates and you can use it as a pad.

The things I didn't like:
Webcam - its 2022 and 80$ phones have decent cameras, It's a pity laptop producers don't put better web cameras in their PC's.
Second is the screen. Resolution is good, but the brightness is a bit low. Also colors feel a bit inaccurate a bit yellowish and washed out."," April 29, 2022",4.0

,"Unbelievably negative experience. I’m actually thinking of filing a report with the BBB.

This is a small summary as I’m out of steam from dealing with this and don’t have the energy to list everything that went wrong.

I got my computer in April.

By October, it was unusable – I woke up one evening at 3 am to beeping. My computer screen went black and the computer non-responsive. As in, nothing. No key responses, no reset. Nothing. I tried the Lenovo chat – took me awhile to get a rep and was told to type this/type that. I kept explaining I can’t type anything – the computer is dead, screen is black. No it’s not the power, battery etc. Each rep kept trying to sell me additional warranty service during this time.

A series of chats later, many of which were the same recycled instructions – I was asked to mail my computer into the repair center in TX (I’m in NY) – no service centers here apparently. While out for repair, I got multiple emails stating I had signed up for their extended warranty and to ""click here"" to pay.
I remember being asked about this numerous times and clearly saying no – so why am I getting these emails?

Well I just got my computer back today and it arrived smashed. To make matters worse – it arrived power on and I’m locked out. So I got back a smashed computer that’s running.

I just tried the chat 6 times in a row and got disconnected al 6 times. I should mention that I tried calling the number on my repair slip – that I am to call if I’m “not completely satisfied.” This number was disconnected. No, I’m not kidding.

I looked up the new tech line onine and called - the line hung up on me 3 times in a row. I tried the chat and it dropped me 6 times after connecting me to a rep. After two hours of trying to reach Lenovo and getting hung up on and/or chat drops I am giving up.

Never buying their products again and filing a report w/ BBB regarding my utterly useless and smashed computer. Thanks for returning it in worse shape than I sent it. Unbelievably bad customer service and product. Do not recommend."," November 15, 2022",4.0
Worst experience with a laptop and customer service. I should have trusted the other reviews.,"This is the first time I have a computer with a touchscreen, and I’m in love. This computer is on the smaller side and it’s very light, and along with the touchscreen it makes it very versatile. The battery lasts for about 7 hours for me and charges back up very quickly (less than 2 hours per my estimate). The screen is HD and the speakers being on either side of the keyboard make a great video-watching experience.

The combination of having 16GB for RAM and having a decent processor also make this computer incredibly fast and allows you to do several things at the same time (like voice & video + text messaging and having several other apps open). Definite recommend!"," August 25, 2022",4.0

"Versatile, fast, HD screen and sound","I've been stumbling along for a while with a six-year-old Lenovo laptop. Time to update. I've had good luck with Lenovo, so I searched and found this model. Ideapad Flex 5 14 Laptop.

It's been 100% satisfactory for basic computing tasks. Email, web browsing, shopping and doing all the daily digital tasks you have. It comes with a 512 GB SSDI. Get it with 16 GB of RAM. (The difference between 8 GB and 16 GB of RAM is breathtaking.) It is fast and responsive.

Like most PCs, it doesn't have enough USB ports. Fortunately, you can get high-quality, multi-outlet USB hubs for almost nothing. It also doesn't have an ethernet port. I had no idea those were being phased out. Doesn't really matter; the Wi-Fi is quick and easy.

Comes with Windows 11. Not as daunting as I thought. You'll figure it out.

This can be your go-to digital device. Let it.

The track pad at times seems to have a glitch to where it will jump around the screen, which can be increasingly annoying waiting for it to function properly again. The last flaw in minor, the backlit keyboard has to be turned on every time you want to use it, it doesn't stay on for long once activated you have to click fn + spacebar to re-activate it. I'm assuming the backlit keyboard and brightness are due to having a little big longer battery life.

An ok laptop,"I was thrilled when I scored a deal on this 2-in-1 laptop, the small storage space didn't bother me in the slightest because that could be upgraded and I'd still come out ahead. What wasn't made very clear to me and apparently many other buyers is that the USB-C port is DATA ONLY. Meaning if you had hopes of connecting your usb-c hub to this and outputting to multiple monitors then you are very out of luck. I wasn't even looking for a 3 monitor setup. My office is setup so that I like to keep my laptop closed and use 2 27"" monitors for my display/extended display. Unless there is an usb-c to usb-a 3.2 adapter that would allow the hub to function that way (???) Then im afraid this is a huge miss.
I had read poor reviews regarding the dimly lit display but brushed them aside knowing I would rarely ever be using the actual laptop display as opposed to my dual monitor setup. So I'm outside the return window and stuck with a machine whose display is as poor as advertised and does not support multiple video out feeds (there is a built in HDMI but this would only allow you to ""extend"" your laptop screen or replace it).

I'm not sure if the heat from the laptop causes fog marks to appear on the screen after closing the laptop, but it's there.

I am supposed to be joyous in this gift, instead, I am frustrated and pissed as a parrot. Lenovo has tainted their rep with this $2 deceit- I wont look at their products again.
By the way, Amazon did a crappy job packing... it was sliding around in the box more than it should, and they delivered it to the wrong address. A horrible experience all the way around, but the USB C part is underhanded... the user does not have usb c. Lenovo used it to get a cheaper connector... yet including it in the port description, implying you can use it to charge your phone or.... pure deception.
Done with Lenovo.

I dont know what other points the product fails in, I didn't boot it, but i suspect given the above, there are other spiders in the sheets. A company like Lenovo. Unbelievable, blow out customers over a $2 manufacturing savings by lying to them.

,"I bought this brand new laptop in June. In August (two months), the battery stopped charging. Lenovo sent a repair person to my house, and it appeared to be fixed. This week, the battery started charging intermittently again. I once again called Lenovo, and this time they told me I had to mail the laptop to them, which they would then keep for up to TWO WEEKS without providing a replacement to use in the interim. They told me it was because I was out of the premium warranty period of three months. I explained that it was the same issue that occured within the initial three-month period, and they clearly hadn't repaired it correctly, or it wouldn't be happening again. No matter what I said, they would not offer any option other than to return my essentially brand new lap top for a few weeks.

 Laptop works great beforehand but after a forced Windows 11 update, part of the update was a BIOS update. After the reboot from the update, the laptop is bricked. No bios load, just a black screen with the caps light on with the keyboard backlight on for a few moments. You can't even get bios from secondary display. Recovery is impossible from USB, side load, or any other method. I have only had this laptop 8 months. I am a dual degreed computer scientist who has over 25 years of experience.

They suggested I ship the faulty machine back to the Lenovo service center in the USA. Which will cost me a fortune, and there was no option of getting the service done locally or somewhere close.

Another minor gripe is all of the USB ports are on the left side and very close to each other. It would have been nice to have one on the right side for a wired mouse.

Everything else is mid-tier except for the nice 20GB for all your chrome browser tabs and speedy bootup.

Pros: The screen is giant and easy to read! So much bigger than most laptops. Functions as I would expect a computer to function. No issues so far in functionality. Connects to the internet relatively quickly.

Cons: The battery only lasts 2-3 hours tops. Constantly having to charge is frustrating. Also, I wish there was a USB port on the right side of the laptop. This would make sense for an external mouse. It does not have touchscreen. It would be nice, but not a dealbreaker for me.

Great Machine for Everyday Use,"I was happy to initially find this computer for my son when he had to shift to at home school due to the pandemic. I purposely didn't want him to have all the bells and whistles of a fancy computer, but I didn't want him in a Chromebook which was too limiting. The problem with Lenovo is #1 The computers are terrible! They work just fine, until they don't. Then they just totally die and are unable to even turn on. (I have since found out this is a common issue with Lenovo from multiple Best Buy/Geek Squad employees.) #2 The customer service is absolutely terrible! #3 I paid for THE most expensive comprehensive coverage plan and insurance so that I would never have a problem. Then when I had a problem, no one would help me and they sent all over to multiple Best Buys and told me to buy more and more stuff (which they then, wouldn't return.) After 20+ calls, running all over to multiple towns and shops, calls to amazon, the insurance provider, etc., I finally talked to one Lenovo sales rep at Best Buy who said to me ""Look, I'm just going to level with you - Lenovo computers are terrible. - Just get a better one and try to get your money back. They'll fight you on it, but keep trying - they are liable."" So that's what I did. I couldn't be happier with my son's new computer. As I type this as I'm sitting her waiting for my ""return label"" for a new power cord that they convinced me to buy at the end of July. I knew before I even received that cord on Aug 5th, that I was done with Lenovo forever. 6 calls into the company so far over these 4 months and no return label and no refund for this overpriced cord that is still sitting in the unopened box. Every time I call they say ""Let me put in an email request for a return label - watch for it in your inbox!"" This is BS. Nothing ever comes of it and when I call back in 5-7 days they act like this is the first call I've ever made to them. I don't usually write negative reviews, but I hate these guys so much. I've spent probably 100+ hours just trying to get ANY of my money back. Thank goodness for Amazon, who stepped in and said that I should have been covered and they will honor at least the main purchase. The items I bought directly from the company, I'm out of course.

,"Some context: I have also had the 128 GB SSD Acer Aspire, and no other laptops recently. I think that both this and that are good computers for everyday use where super-high performance is not essential. I currently give this the edge, for reasons I'll note below.
The good:
1. I've had this for a year now, and it still works about the same. No hardware issues, storage hasn't been an issue, and speed hasn't degraded.
1. The 256 GB storage is plenty for most of the applications I could want.
2. Price, duh. Cheaper PC's exist, but I chose this specifically on the basis of the storage.
The neutral:
1. Not lightning-fast, but fast enough for my needs, including some pretty compute-intensive machine learning work. If you want to play fancy new games, get a different computer. If you want to train massive neural nets without waiting ages, rent a GPU.
2. Windows 10 is a good OS, and it's easy to change the factory settings to allow installation of apps that aren't from the Microsoft store.
The bad:
1. The charger is big and clunky. It's harder to find outlets to plug it into because it needs like two inches horizontal clearance.
2. The battery life is pretty bad - maybe 4-5 hours when I first bought it, and now down to maybe 3 hours a few months after I bought it. But most of the decline in battery life happened soon after I bought it."," December 19, 2021",5.0

,"Thing works great! I'm super pleased with the performance for the price!

Note: I don't really use the touchscreen (except on accident) and for the couple times I folded it in half to try out tablet-mode; which I found to be a bit unwieldy due to it's size.

I specifically bought this because I've always had a high-end frame of mind for pc performance. So this is the wimpiest processor I've every bought in a device. I typically spend big and then keep the device for a decade. Ex the dell xps 17"" I bought in 2012, is still wildly faster than my work laptop with the cheapest i5 money can buy. I absolutely loathe that on my work Lenovo i5 8GB RAM, I can barely use accuweather.com or weather.com because of all the ads. The fan spins up and usually the pages will crash. <- obviously a distraction from THIS device, but wanted to give context, these experiences mean I'd never consider a machine with an i5, let alone a lowly i3.

Fast forward to a few months ago, spent a few weeks trying to recover as much as I could from my grandpa's failing disk. I was working on fixing it, restoring the image I collected from the spinning disk to SSD etc. After fighting with the unbearably slow hardware I decided that I was going to gather the troops (grandkids) and solicit donations to replace it for him. Ended up with a 17"" Acer (or maybe Asus, idr) but the thing that stuck out was the i3 1115g4 that was in it. I thought this thing was going to work at a snail's pace, and I was pleasantly surprised that a not-top-end, heck not-even-middle-grade processor, could be so snappy (thanks NVMe's!!!). I worked with it a bit setting it up for him and thought it was great.

So I bought this Chromebook because a) Wirecutter recommended it b) it had the same processor as ""Papa's"" Windows 11 laptop. I figured with ChromeOS being super lightweight, this processor would have no issues keeping up with a bunch of chrome windows and tabs. It keeps right up, I hear the fan spin up only rarely, and really only when I have lots of tabs open. Honestly it only gets choked up when you visit a website riddled with ads, I'm looking at you weather sites, MSN (exclusively for testing if adblockers work ;-)).
Grain of Salt: I DO have a network level ad-blocker that I installed over the summer, so a lot of ads are blocked, and everything seems snappier when a majority of ads can't load.

Cons:
I find it irritating that the keyboard lacks F keys, though there's a setting you can set to replace the fn buttons with typical f-key actions. There's also no home/end, page-up/down keys for easily selecting a line of text, but the right combinations of the shift/ctrl/alt keys + arrow keys somewhat reproduce this.

Just OK:
I have 1440p monitors, so falling back to 1080 on this leaves me desiring a little more screen real estate. Camera is just ok, but I love the built in slider for blocking it.

Overall, fantastic, would 100% buy again, I happily paid $365 for it on sale, but today it's $317.99, and I once almost ordered one for my wife (maybe pre-prime sale?) for $279 but I took a few hours to ""think about it"" and they were out of stock."," November 26, 2022",5.0
"Awesome for browsing more ""Amazon Day""",Nice Chromebook but the A does not type easily and I have to forever fix my texts and emails," June 20, 2023",5.0
,"UPDATE: I took the panel off the bottom to have a look, and the 64gb storage is indeed a normal 42mm long m.2 ssd. So it is removable and replaceable.

Continue previous review:

The other previous reviewer is correct, this is the Flex 5i, 8gb ram 11th gen i3 (not 10th) unit. Mine came with the advertised 64gb of storage. The description portion of this listing is the old 5, but the worded lower description is correct with the current 5i information.

This is a great 2 in 1 chromebook. I have never owned one before, and did a ton of research for months before getting this one for business. I have a pixel 3xl, and (with some occasional issues) am able to link and utilize the phone and its data connection, conversations, etc. For 450 bucks, this is a snappy unit. The i3 may not be as powerful as the more expensive i5 cpu's, but it is plenty for this device.

Flipping it into tablet mode works as expected. I haven't bothered to get a pen for it, as I don't do drawing or really need to write very often. I may eventually pick up on designed for chromebooks like this. (the lenovo brand pen seems to have some flaws, based on reviews). The touch screen seems nice as-is.

NOTE: if you are a single person business owner, and have google workspace as your email and google system, then you will have to pay google even more just to use this chromebook with your business address, and then learn how to enable all of the settings through the admin console online. It's stupid, but what can you do if you want to use your business email address as the user on a chromebook. You could use a gmail account but then it isn't linked to your Workspace system on an OS level.

Also note, you can install linux through the chrome OS as a container in the settings options. It's fairly straight-forward. I have installed Steam through that, and the flex 5i does surprisingly well as a light-gaming unit. (currently you can turn on Proton mode in steam's settings to play more windows based games). You can also flip it into tablet mode and play Slay the Spire or Mini Motorways in touch-mode. I have not tried to push the system, so I'm not sure what it can handle, but 2D games like those or Dead Cells run really great. HOWEVER: Until Valve releases an official chromebook OS app with Proton, game controllers simply do not work right now. Chrome just doesn't handle any game input currently. So controllers are out until then.

The keyboard is pretty decent. It has a backlight. Useful shortcut keys up top.

The front webcam is pretty terrible. Not sure what I expected, but it works. It has a privacy shield, which is great.

Lastly, When you flip it into tablet mode, and want to set it down, there's no rubber feet to protect the keyboard-side-surface of the laptop that will now be on a table or whatnot. It's just the smooth surface, so don't set it down anywhere you might scratch it up. I may eventually add tiny little pieces of rubber just to give it a fraction of a mm of clearance off a surface and keep it from slipping."," January 31, 2022",5.0

This is the newest 5i,"I purchased the Flex as a backup for my ageing Macbook Pro. I was put off when Apple informed me that they no longer would service my 9 year old Mac. This chromebook cost less than trying to get a local non-Apple service tech to fix my Macbook. Fast forward: a few weeks ago my Macbook died as expected. So.. I started using the Flex as my main computer. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Flex replaced my Macbook. It loads pages faster, the battery lasts much longer, it has a touch screen for Kindle, and for most of the things I do, is more than adequate. Originally, I thought I would be using the Flex as an interim solution until I was able to buy a new Macbook. So far, the Flex has been so good, that I probaly will never buy another Mac. Yes, the screen on the Macbook is better. But, for most of the things I do, this is irrelevant."," January 4, 2023",5.0

Great deal!,"I'm really not happy with the purchase of this machine. The first one arrived, we charged it, and the screen would not work. We confirmed the battery was green and working, and that the blinking light on the power button meant it was in sleep mode. We tried all of the tips on Lenovo's help forum to no avail. Upon scanning the QR code, we discovered we were already three months into the warranty. So we returned it for an exchange. When the new one came today we scanned the code again. This one as well was a couple of months into warranty. So, we hunted around on their website and found an article that they base the warranty start date on when a supplier purchases the machine and add a single month. I have tried several times to update the warranty via their ticket process yet, every time I go to actually submit the ticket, it's freezing and not going through. This one so far at least seems to work. However, they should include information on the warranty with the device. At the very least they should make it clear on their site without having to hunt it down that they have a process to update it (assuming it works as I've been unsuccessful thus far)."," July 28, 2022",5.0

Nice tablet with keyboard but wish Chrome wasn't so ad happy,"Quick and responsive Chromebook, replaced a $150 Acer 11"" Chromebook that was about 6 years old and now out of updates, OMG what a night and day difference, glad i made the purchase.

Screen is definitely a step up from the ones you'll see on entry level Chromebooks like the one i upgraded from, fit and finish seem decent so far after a month of owning it. Battery life will run for about 7-8 hours with screen at 75% brightness while doing normal stuff from full battery charge. Keyboard is alright, I like clicky ones on my desktop, but i realize your not going to get that experience out of a 3 lb Chromebook. Don't use the touch screen much but it seems decent in the couple of times I've played with it, I plan on giving one of these to my digital art loving daughter at Christmas and we'll see what she says about the touch screen. It doesn't scream premium like the $1,000 Chromebooks but at this price $300 I don't have to worry about something happening to it and I get 75% of the performance of those high end machines at 30% of the price.

,"It was a fair price for Chromebook with an I3 processor. I just wanted something for browsing the web and it fit the bill. It has one severe flaw, it has no soft reset option. That is to hold a key or sticking paper clip in a hole to reset it when it crashes and fails to do something like wake up from sleep mode. I was only given the option to send it in at my expense with no promise that it would be fixed. So I chose to void the warrant and opened it up and disconnected the battery. I've been forced to do this three more times, usually after a chrome OS update when it dials back to the default settings. I therefore frequently check for updates.

Great Chromebook for 2nd machine,"I just received this chromebook, so I haven't had a chance to run through its paces, but I wanted to add some information to clarify some of the questions I had about this purchase based on some of the contradictions in the description:

The processor is the more recent intel Core i3-1555G4. You'll see other versions of this laptop out there with the Core i3-10110U, which is the prior year's model.
The more modern Core i3 is probably only an incremental improvement. The real benefit comes with google's update schedule for ChromeOS. The models of this laptop with the newer chip have an extra year of OS updates (they'll stop getting updates in June 2029, instead of June 2028).
The item I received has 128 GB of storage, not 64 GB (which is great, because the only reservation I had about buying this model was whether 64 GB would be enough memory). You probably don't need a lot of memory for a chromebook (the idea is that you do the vast majority of stuff online) but I like the comfort of know the storage is there. Who knows, maybe I'll learn how to use Linux!
It does include 8 GB of RAM.
The 2021 version of this Chromebook (with that intel Core i3-1555G4) is sometimes referred to as the Flex 5i. This might be relevant if you're trying to find professional reviews or comparison shop."," January 6, 2022",4.0

Better specs than I thought,I purchased a Chromebook Instead of a window laptop because the majority of stuff I do is online. I have a desktop computer that is collecting dust. Since my phone pretty much did everything I needed. I don't do much gaming anymore hence the reason not using my desktop anymore. I needed a bigger screen for when I type word document or fill out forms. Its just much easier to do on my Chromebook. This Lenovo will run most mobile games just fine.

,"I purchased this Flex 5i with 64GB eMMC (~$300) and the one with 128GB Samsung SSD (~$400) to compare. Using chrome:\\system I confirmed they are running the same CPU, the same amount of memory (8GB), and the same platform (Volteer) . Although there doesn't seem to be much hardware difference, their performance is noticeably different. The 64GB unit's Linux virtual machine is completely tying up the CPU, while it is using a very small percent of CPU resources/time on the 128GB unit. On the 64GB unit, 10 tabs in Chrome is all it takes to see significant lag when switching between tabs, and sometimes the mouse lags and jumps around the screen. I only saw this behavior on the 128GB unit after opening something like 40 tabs, and even then it wasn't as bad. The other extremely noticeable difference is that the 64GB unit can only drive an external 1920 x 1080 display at 30Hz interlaced, resulting in obvious motion blur while scrolling on websites, while the 128GB unit can drive the same display at full 60Hz with no observable motion blur.

Seller is contradictory but it is an i3 with 8 gigs at a GREAT price. However, I think these didn't pass any quality testing. The screen on mine was not properly laminated in and I have to think it will eventually get much worse so I am returning it. It wasn't damaged as the box and chassis were in perfect shape.

Factory Second? Deceptive advertising? Return policy!,"I purchased one of these in August. I really liked the feature set, in particular the 8 Gb Ram, and a backlit keyboard. That one had problems with the keyboard. The Tab, Search, Shift, CTRL 1, q, a, z keys all rattled. That one also had issues with the display. The display has areas in the upper left and upper right side which were displaying as lighter color. It was most noticeable on a dark background. I returned it and ordered a second one which has the same problem with the keyboard. It did not have the problem with the display.

 I am loving this laptop so far, and I only had it for a few days. Key takeaway is how lightweight it is, which is a must-have for me when acquiring a decent laptop. Not too small when it comes to productivity and entertainment purposes, but not too big to where it will feel like I am carrying a cinderblock on the go, so great job on that, Lenovo. The material seems to be durable enough to withstand some minor damages, so no complaints about that yet. I found out that SSDs run faster than HDDs so that explains why the performance rate is so phenomenal! I love it! Boots up in seconds and I have not dealt with any stuttering after installing a good number of apps on to it. I also love how it turns itself on the moment I open the lid. Fascinating indeed, Lenovo! Lastly, the battery life is outstanding! It instantly charges up to 100% percent in a matter of minutes, and with the charger unplugged, the battery can last for up to 3 in a half hours give or take so high-five to you, Lenovo!

I did a couple of benchmark tests on a gaming scale, and from a rating of 1 to 10, I will give that a 5.5 because some games can run good on the lowest settings (I am not picky when it comes to graphics, so I do not care for the extreme graphics quality when playing video games like most people do), but because this laptop was not built for gaming, I can’t make the rating any higher than that. Actually, this is my first time ever owning a laptop running off an AMD processor and graphics card, and I am quite impressed in terms of processor performance. I am now convinced that AMD processors run way better than Intel processors (comparing between the AMD Ryzen 5 vs. Intel Core i5 to be fair). As for graphics card performance, NVIDIA still takes the W, but like I said. This laptop was not built for gaming so no big issue on that.

I really feel like a professional typer when using this laptop, and I do like the webcam shutter feature. All laptops should come with that!!! I typed this review up on this laptop so I can vouch for the keyboard layout lol. This laptop actually gives meaning to the name itself so thumbs up to Lenovo for that. Quick and easy setup. Sound quality is decent, but is not terrible. Resolution is quite basic on laptop screen, but I mean, this laptop runs smooth enough on 1920 x 1080, so solution for that is to connect to a 2nd screen for better experience when streaming videos and movies or watching them offline. Screen flexibility is nice. I like that I can level the lid far back enough to turn the laptop into a reader-mode like position if I want to hold it in my hand while reading an article on the screen or something. Wi-Fi connectivity is great. I have not used the Bluetooth feature yet but I assume its great also. The touchpad works well enough to where an optimal mouse is actually optional, not essential unlike most laptops nowadays. USB ports work fine but I do not like how they are positioned, and I tend to struggle to put USB devices into them every now and then, especially in the 2.0 port. Not sure if it’s because I am just weak or an actual design flaw. I even mistaken the HDMI port to be an USB port due to how they are positioned, but that does not affect the rating because I cannot control how Lenovo designs their computers so it is something I have to be okay with especially since I bought it. HDMI port works great, but I wish this laptop came with a display port. Headphone jack works perfectly with both speakers and headphones/earphones.

In conclusion, I would recommend this to someone who just needs a basic laptop to do their work on, listen to music, and watch their favorite videos on YouTube or offline on a screen bigger than their smartphone. It is affordable, especially when you catch it at the right price before it goes up. Most importantly, manufactured by Lenovo, so you cannot go wrong with that. I will make sure I cherish this laptop for a very long time. Let’s hope I can manage up to 6 years with it lol unless I make enough money to afford a high-end gaming computer."," September 28, 2020",5.0
Best Budget Lenovo Laptop ever bought!,"Although this laptop has an attractive exterior, its screen quality is disappointing and appears to be cheaply made. Additionally, the keyboard is very poor and the larger keys seem to be protruding. The touchpad also seems to be slightly raised on one side. I can even see the backlight shining through the cap lock key and power button, which indicates poor quality control. Furthermore, the fan sometimes makes noise.

I paid $449 for this laptop, but I regret my purchase because my friend was able to buy an HP laptop with a core i5 processor for $399, which is significantly better in terms of quality and performance."," May 2, 2023",5.0
,"The Lenovo Ideapad 3 14 laptop is a very solid laptop and a must-buy for just $450.

To start off with the pros,

This laptop is very light, portable, fast, and powerful. I'm a college student going into I.T. and I edit videos a lot. The RAM, GPU, and CPU can easily handle that type of workload for 1080p video. The Ryzen 5 3500U with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics is more than capable of handling light gaming, 1080p editing, Unity/Unreal/Blender rendering, and absolutely blazes through everyday tasks.

The keyboard has a phenomenal feel to it. While it's definitely no Thinkpad keyboard, it feels much better than most laptop keyboards out there. The membranes give a nice, tactile, solid feel to each large key, providing a comfortable, solid, satisfying typing experience.

The 256GB NVMe SSD gives the laptop a very snappy speed, with a near-instant boot time. While the storage capacity is definitely not vast, it makes up for it in speed. The Ideapad 3 also includes 2 USB 3.0 ports, so an external SSD/HDD is definitely a viable option if you want more storage on the laptop. (it's what I did.)

The 1080p display is crisp, sharp , and beautiful (if you spend some time color adjusting the screen in the Radeon settings.) It's definitely more than viable for watching movies, streaming TV shows, or editing videos in 1080p.

Now for the cons,

The Ideapad 3's battery is definitely not a poor one, but it's far from great. On max performance mode, I rarely get more than 2 hours of battery life out of this computer on full brightness. However, running this on the ""better battery"" mode barely sacrifices any performance for me, and I've been able to get a significant 4-6 hours of battery life when running that mode.

The trackpad is a very smooth experience, yet moving your finger around on it produces a weird knocking sound occasionally, but I've found this to quiet down as the laptop is used more often. Minor gripe.

I know a lot of people have complained about the screen on this computer, but honestly, it's far from a bad display. Sure, it only goes up to 220 nits (from my testing) so it can't realistically be used outside on a sunny day, but for indoor use, even in a bright room, the display is easy to look at and is bright enough to be very clear. Now, keep in mind, the screen comes with all the downfalls of a TN panel, with viewing angles being rather lackluster, but while looking straight at the computer, there's few displays you can get that beats this one for a sub $500 laptop paired with this powerful hardware.

In conclusion,

If you're looking for a good laptop for under $500 that doesn't look or feel cheap despite the (very solid in my opinion) plastic construction, this Lenovo is an absolute no-brainer. The Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 provides performance akin to laptops over double this one's price. If portability, power, and convenience are what you're keeping an eye out for, I can easily highly recommend this computer.

Thanks for reading my review!"," August 3, 2020",5.0
This laptop has some good features but also has a few flaws.,"I was looking for a reasonably priced laptop with decent CPU speed, 1920/1080 screen resolution, Windows 10 Home edition, good looks, solid feel. Debated between 15"" and 14"" screen and decided against 15"" because I do not need the number keys on the right of the keyboard and the extra weight that comes with the larger laptop. Windows 10 S was a non-starter because it limits the apps to the Microsoft store only. Windows Home edition requires 8 GB of RAM for optimal performance. As of January'20, the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 was the best option for me.

After a week with the laptop, I think it was reasonably fast for browsing out of the box and on the slow side for running PC apps. Out of the 8 GB RAM, it turned out that 2.2 GB was reserved, leaving only 5.8 GB available. Task Manager showed that RAM was becoming a bit of a bottleneck, so I upgraded the 4 GB removable memory card (the other 4 GB are soldered onto the motherboard) to an 8 GB card and the difference in speed was astounding - browsing is noticeably faster and the PC apps that I run take half the time to boot up and to run identical functions. If you are upgrading, know that memory speed (frequency) on this CPU is limited to 2400 MHz. Interestingly, the factory card that came out of the laptop was rated at 3200 MHz to allow overclocking. I put in a 2666 MHz card, but it will run at 2400 MHz anyway.

Other positives with this laptop are that it has one of the best keyboards I have seen anywhere - with oversize keys and just the right amount of resistance. it would have been perfect for me if it weren't for the lack of keyboard illumination. It also has a fairly quiet fan that you barely hear even in a quiet room. The laptop weighs only 3.3 lbs and feels light. I love the blue cover finish and it has a solid feel all around. Narrow screen bezel is great. Camera shutter is a nice feature. Screen hinge is very solid.

On the downside, the screen colors and contrast are underwhelming and I spent a lot of time tweaking the graphics card to improve them. It made a noticeable difference but there is still a bluish hue that simply refuses to go away without a significant impact to contrast and clarity. The screen is also not bright enough to use outdoors and it has a very narrow viewing angle. The touchpad makes some clunky noises and overall is not very responsive. It does take some getting used to but seems to be getting a bit better with gradual use.

Overall, this is a a very good sub-$500 laptop, best I could find for that price and great value for the money. Definitely upgrade the memory card to 8 GB. Also, worth comparing this laptop to the Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop, which is a viable option if you are looking for a 15"" screen. The Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is a big step up in processing power and overall specs but the Acer Aspire 5 comes with a bigger screen with better clarity, illuminated keyboard, and costs over $100 less. With a memory card upgrade ($60 for an 8 GB card to 12 GB total) and a free OS upgrade to Windows 10 Home edition, the Acer is a good alternative if you are willing to upgrade it."," January 9, 2021",5.0
,"It is very difficult to find a good laptop under $500, but this is a solid sub-$500 choice. I have owned this laptop for 3 years and haven’t noticed any issues with it. I have been able to run Steam and play games on this laptop with little to no issues. It isn’t a gaming laptop, but games are definitely playable and it seems to be able to handle most games with the occasional lag. This laptop is great for basic use and school or work use. It is a relatively fast laptop, especially for the price.

The screen took me a while to get used to, though I am not sure if this was just my own personal issue or if the screen just takes time to get used to. Eventually I did get used to the screen. It is not a touch-screen laptop, which is what a lot of people might want. But, despite it not being touch-screen, it is still a really nice laptop.

In terms of aesthetics, the color isn’t quite like what is pictured. It’s a much darker blue, more like navy blue. The laptop is pretty thin and isn’t too heavy, which makes it good for travel."," March 14, 2023",5.0
Can't Beat The Price For This Performance!,"I normally don't do reviews but, if you're like me you also scoured the internet and found nothing on this laptop based on the model number provide or the pictures. There's conflicting information from the representative and the photos/specs provided so this is the specs as it sits in my hands.

Specs:
All plastic shell
IdeaPad 3 14ADA05 81W0003QUS
Ryzen 5 3500u
3 USB-A ports, 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0, there is no USB-C on this device. Do not use the answer from the representative as correct on this one. I even asked a more clarifying question and was told there is a USB-C, but you cannot charge over it.
The screen is a 1920x1080 TN panel, no touch screen
256GB NVME drive - no spinning HDD, so disregard the section that says 7200rpm on the description page
8gb of DDR4 ram at 2400mhz
3 cell battery - seems okay power saving options gives it roughly 8hrs depending on what you're doing and your tolerable screen brightness (but your mileage may vary)
There is no back lit keyboard. The keys feel textured and not smooth like some other laptops which, personally I prefer it.

Review:
This appears to be Lenovo's answer to the mid-grade $400-$600 laptop shortage. If I had to guess it seems like this is in the chaise of the S145 with a 3500u APU.

Compared to my wife's Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-14API with the same processor, ram, and SSD - performance wise it matches, but that's not the end of it. Her computer has what feels to be an all metal design, the ability to flip into a tablet, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, and a much better IPS display (still 1920x1080) with better viewing angles. We purchased this for her last July, 2019 and the difference of final price was ~$75 higher. At the time of writing this the same laptop goes for $750 on Amazon for the ""New"" model and $699 for a used model.

Conclusion:
If you need a sub $500 laptop right now, this is a solid purchase as long as you know what you're getting. If on the other hand you have the luxury of waiting a few months I would wait.

If the prices/stock stabilize you can get much more bang for your buck for nearly the same amount of money. More laptops with the Ryzen 5 4500u is going to be coming out over the summer with 20% more power and it's suppose to come in at a similar price point. Even if they come at a higher price point it will drive the price of the 3500u down."," May 23, 2020",5.0

Good value for the money,"This is probably the best value for the money laptop I could find after extensive research. Sure, there's been deals with other laptops with an AMD 3500u inside but that was before the pandemic + prices have gone back up to normal.

Now, the laptop. For $450, you're getting the AMD 3500u with the included Vega 8 GPU, 8GB RAM, 256gb SSD. The screen itself is nothing to die for. It's 1080p 60hz, and you definitely have to adjust the viewing angle sometimes because it can be too overexposed or too underexposed when viewing from extreme angles but it's a good screen in the end

The magic of this laptop comes from the price point vs. performance

The 3500u totally demolishes any intel equivalent laptops at this price range out of the water, and the fact that it is an APU that comes with Vega 8 graphics is a godsend

a i5 8250u (the price equivalent of the amd 3500u) with it's integrated graphics does half of the performance in games that the Vega 8 achieves, this can mean the difference between viewing a powerpoint presentation and getting a consistent and playable frame-rate

Take GTA V for example. The Vega 8 achieves for me 1080p 35-45FPS with all ""Normal"" settings, and 720p 50-70FPS. The intel equivalent will only run you up to 720p 35-45FPS. Don't even try 1080p, at only 15-25FPS.

Rocket League at 720p performance settings on the i5-8250u? 40-60FPS. Try 70-80FPS on the 3500u/Vega 8 combo.

Fortnite? (yes I know) - 720p 35-45FPS on the 3500u. Try 20-30FPS on the i5-8250u.

Enough gaming. Battery is fine on light workloads, and it charges super quickly. Like others have noted, some of the information on this amazon listing is wrong so do your research!

Either way, I'm really happy with this laptop. Definitely is a good machine at a good price point. Great for work and for some light games. I would definitely recommend this laptop as well if you want to gift it to a child/teen for school + knowledge that it can run titles like Fortnite, Minecraft, etc and are on a budget."," June 4, 2020",5.0
,"This laptop has been doing well for me so far. The screen is a bit dimmer than I'd love and the speakers honestly suck (quieter than my Samsung Galaxy Note 10). But unless you're planning on showing a room full of people some music/videos, the speakers don't matter. The laptop ran great right out of the box with fast boot up times, but once I started downloading my different applications, it slowed down noticeably. Not so much that it's a problem, but enough that it was disappointing. When running multiple high demand applications it can be a bit clunky as well.

Internet browsing works perfectly fine.

As for gaming. This laptop surprised me as it can actually run some of my games smooth enough to play (on very low settings of course). I recommend single player games only as multiplayer games begin to push it into unplayable. An example being, Minecraft on near lowest settings is playable with no noticeable frame rate issues. But when I logged into a server with a friend, even when it was just the two of us on the server, I had a lot of frame rate issues. But I tried stuff like Dead Space, Stardew Valley, Hades, and Minecraft and they all ran well enough.

Streaming is another iffy area as it puts even more stress on the system. So if you want to stream more simple games like Stardew Valley and Hades, it works perfectly fine. But Minecraft on the absolute lowest settings possible while in a server was unplayable still.

I'll update this if anything ever comes up that is noteworthy."," April 22, 2021",5.0
Best Under-$500 Laptop!,"You get a lot for your money with this laptop. It has Windows 11, though it said 10, which is important. It is fast and allows me to open multiple screens with ease if needed. It's small and lightweight, but the screen is clear and works well for conferencing. Love the keyboard."," March 5, 2023",5.0
,"I like this laptop, but everything is overshadowed by its deplorable screen. The display is horribly washed out to the point that all blacks are grays and all colors are desaturated. I've done everything I can to calibrate this display with only the remotest of success. It looks better than it did out of the box but you're not going to get any sort of vibrancy or color accuracy from this machine short of hooking it up to a proper monitor. It's SUPER disappointing and I hate it every day.

That said, the rest of this machine is pretty solid. It's ultra light, super silent, the battery lasts about 5 hours watching video, probably like 3hours for gaming, and up to 8 if you're just working and listening to music. The keyboard's pretty good; I'm a writer and everything is comfortable and responsive. Kind of a pain to clean as the caps don't pop off. Sound is surprisingly good but takes a while to break in (don't judge it for a week or so). It has enough and the right kinds of ports that your average person's needs, all very good.

And, honestly, for the specs this laptop is a great price. I can play Sims 4 on max graphics with Youtube running in the background with no issues. That's really all I can ask for. For working purposes, you can have as many tabs open as you need as well as work programs like Office Suite, Photoshop, etc. You're not going to be playing Cyberpunk 2077 on this laptop, but for light-to-middling gaming it should be fine.

Too bad the display let's this otherwise well-specced, very portable light-gaming laptop down. What a shame."," December 13, 2020",5.0
"Great specs, fair build, trash display.","I love the computer and did months researching exactly what I wanted for my 8 year old son who loves gaming, wanted TABS and wants to learn coding. This was perfect since it isn’t a gaming computer but pretty damn. Lose. He also starts school tomorrow and I hoped he would ha e it for school, but of course that was too much to ask.
We had problems from day one. I set up the computer and it looked great. I bought tabs, cuphead and Minecraft. I couldn’t download tabs because I didn’t have an andmin code which was never prompted to make when I was sitting up. It is connected to the whole families Microsoft and I am the organzier, but my code wouldn’t work. Nothing would. Then the screen went black. I couldn’t tur it on or do anything. A friend of mine visiting for the weekend helped me get it back running but when he did that, instead of just my sons name down in left corner, was administrator, admin and default user. My friend said it wouldn’t matter. He was wrong. I cannot download tabs or anything else, make changes to the laptop like restart to factory settings and almost anything else I need to do. I bought it for my sons bday June 12 2012, he has used it 3 times to play Minecraft and we made him play cuphead the first day. He has never played tabs and that was why he really wanted it.

Even bigger problem is that now my son cannot log in with his password and I cannot login on his laptop either. So it is a very expensive paperwork now. I am very disappointed, I have wanted a Lenovo for years but the touch screens are too high and that’s what I needed for my business. I bought the cheapest Hopi could find with touchscreen and didn’t expect much but it at least lStest a year, now it’s dead, the day after its warrenty. I bought a laptop at a pawn shop because I am doing Telehealthh for mental ill clients and can’t go 5 mins without a laptop. That even lasted longer than the Lenovo that was brand new. I know that when the pawn shop laptop died, I would be in trouble but it died within a month of the brand new warranties Lenovo. So I don’t know what do do. I used my. Only to get my son his computer and could lose my job not having a laptop for work, granted I have to keep my laptop on all day and have word, excel and several internet tabs open at all times. It was a pro book. no warrenty. But my sons laptop should have lasted a really long time with the extra warrenty I bought, the expensive price (cost more than either of my works laptops) and it was brand new with awesome specs and almost no use. I don’t know what to do, I have a devastated boy that he can’t play tabs even though I paid almost $30 for it, he Can’t log in anymore and it already died completely on day one. I don’t have an admin code even if I can find a way to fix this and he starts school tomorrow. I k ow it will be without a laptop which will be hard without a laptop, but he will. This laptop has been nothing but a money pit that has been disappointment and disappointment for my son, me and hours of work I don’t have since I work 20 hrs a day, and have been threatened to lose my job s8nve I fell behind trying to fix it. Assurance, warrenty co said they would email the warrenty, but I haven’t found it yet. I will look yet again, this was weeks ago. I hate that I waisted around $500 for the perfect co outer for my so. When I would have done better to buy the most generic one out there, at least it might have worked and I wouldn’t had paid much for it. So disappointed. In fact, I may lose my job, my son my fail school and I am out over $100 I bought i games. He has Minecraft on his phone and Xbox 360 but I heard it was better on pc. I a, so glad I didn’t buy Minecraft dungeons now, I almost did. Wish I was able to fix this and the computer was worth what it seemed. I now no longer have a working laptop or pc in my house, so work and school will be impossible. Can’t afford to buy a work computer that will hope the ram I need for the work I do but I put all my money into making sure my kids had the best bday. Wish I had taken care of my job first so I could save up and get him a computer that works. Hopefully yours works if you get it, all machinery can be faulty and maybe I got a dud. It looks great, screams pretty and the cord is simple like a chromenooks. I was jealous till i it stopped working. I wish you work with yours and if I find away to fix it I will post it, but it’s been over 2 moths so I don’t thing it will happen. Gonna be an expensive paperweight ❤️. But your could be awesome.

,"Pros:
- Great spec for the price range.
- Easily can run emulators and run up to ps2 games
- very light weight.
- battery run for long period of time.

Cons:
- left click mouse hardly functioning.
- you need to get knowing how to use the mouse
- The laptop was built from cheap plastic

For upgrading:

- I successfully upgrade the 256GB SSD to 1TB (only one storage slot is available) the SSD type was hynix 256GB and I replaced it with NVME M.2 PCie Adata Swordfish 1TB. it works smoothly and fantastic

- you can upgrade to 20GB however once I test the ram performance in (user benchmark) , it appears that the laptop scores 46% in ram performance while the 12GB Scored higher Upto 70%. So I used 12GB instead of 20GB.

The only issue:

After updating the windows 10 to latest version, As normal procedure. it required a reset. Then the Laptop defect. I have 5 other laptops and I am doing the Windows update regularly to all of them. But this ONE is the lowest built quality. The reason I choose the lenovo because I have old lenovo G550 which I bought it before 10 years and it still run strong . However, I successfully manage to reboot it from bios and delete all the firmware and update. The laptop works again but I feel little bit disappointed. The only good thing about idealPad 3 is the price compared to other competitive.

Useless. 1st day black screen. Fixed then required admin code we don’t have now can’t log it,"First off I’ll start by saying that this laptop is pretty decent for the price can’t complain about that, but sadly this product doesn't seem to be heavily supported by Lenovo. I got my laptop a few days ago and used it for one day before having the touchpad give up on me (no my rating on this product will not be affected because i received a defect), I followed the steps on their website to fix this to no avail because they didn’t have the proper hardware updates on their site for this laptop as you can see in their description of the product on the amazon listing page some of the info is wrong. That being said this laptop is pretty decent and I do recommend it for college students and business workers it’s light and very portable, I can hold this with one hand effortlessly the only thing i dislike about the build is the plastic shell, but when you get specs like the AMD RYZEN 5 3500u with Vega 8 graphics and a 256 gb SSD for this price you cant really complain.

More about gaming: I’ve tested games like Warface, Fortnite, and Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 they played well on low settings this pc isn’t bad for that what it wont run that well will be games like call of duty modern warfare, but i’m sure with overclocking and enabling parked cores even that can be played. The screen of the laptop is 60hz so playing these games at 60fps looks smooth.

Tips: If you plan on buying this laptop and you aren’t used to 14 inch screens beware it’s pretty hard to get used to but you will eventually.

Summary: This is a good laptop for work and school it’s pretty powerful and it’s also good for light gaming I recommend it.

Note to Lenovo: Support this product give it touchpad driver updates or Im afraid more people will run into the same problem as me and have to return the product because you aren’t supporting it well enough, I can barely find info or videos on this model at all, but I may consider making one if I do decide to get this model again after I return the defect I received."," June 1, 2020",5.0
,"For the money this laptop meets my needs. I didn't need a power laptop but it seems to load web pages quickly nor slow down too much under a load. I do think the processor/storage throttles a bit when temperatures increase inside. Plays videos withoout issues. Don't play games so I can't speak to that. Wifi downloads @ 300+ and uploads 39 which is what I'm paying for. If it is plugged in or fresh on startup it will score 1500 or more on novabench. Thinking of upgrading the drive with a Samsung (MZ-V7E500BW) 970 EVO SSD 500GB - M.2 NVMe Interface Internal Solid State Drive for more storage and it is supposed to be a bit faster than the stock drive. Probably will add an 8gb memory to replace the 4 on board. Why??? Just to see if performance improves dramatically.
Screen is acceptable for my use but others might be critical of it but for the money it performs well. The trackpad also works very well. If you're looking for something as a secondary laptop this would definitely fill the bill. Battery life was around 3 hrs with heavy use but longer if you just web surfing. Look on youtube for videos for performance comparisons and this laptop seems to stand up fairly well to most challenges."," January 25, 2021",5.0
The only problem was Manufacturing defect after windows update," For the first time in my life I was able to get a laptop. Not only was I confused by the array of choices and what a lap top does, this brand has made me feel so humble.

The specs and hardware can be difficult to understand, but that's okay because you can contact Lenovo support after purchase. I got mine with a payment plan, and I can tell you, I was happy I did so. the PC is amazing and has some sweet mesh work. You can install virus free software to connect your phone to the laptop, so you can work, text, and create in whatever way possible. The processor is more than enough to play most games, and any small work load can be delivered with cloud software given the choice you made to upload and download to your laptop.

The only issue I have with this laptop is that I have no issues with it; it's relatively perfect for any situation. I would suggest this for a lap top, or a gift any day.

,"I purchased a like-new used version, so mine came with some serious software errors that I had to resolve.
I recommend scanning your laptop to see if there are bad sectors in the SSD, or any problems with the memory, ETC. This is very important because bad sectors can cause BSOD AFTER the 1 month return limit. (This is actually also a reminder to myself since I didn't check it yet haha)

Personally, I don't like the color of the TN screen. My BenQ 144hz is also TN and has much better color.
And I really like apple's screens, but I know they are much more expensive and I don't want to bother learning to use mac.

Just using for school, and no games so can't say anything about it performance wise yet.
The battery rating is really low, so that was a concern BUT it doesn't drop much when I just have sticky-notes up. It lasted 2-3 hrs in class when I was just using chrome and sticky notes and dropped only about 20%.

Another concern I had is that 256 GB is not really enough, so I wanted to put a huge GB SD hard in the built-in slow. HOWEVER, the SD card does not go all the way in and sticks out... Not sure why they did that. I wanted to keep my SD card in the laptop the whole time."," February 19, 2022",5.0
Decent Laptop for work and light gaming,"1st Time Lenovo Buyer + Great Gift!
This is my first Lenovo purchase and I couldn't be happier! I bought this for my mother as a gift and it has been running smooth and very fast! I highly recommend this for anyone who has a heavy work scheduled and needs a laptop to keep up with them. It can handle very work intensive tasks of any common programs and software - great for the average ""tab warrior"" (when you always keep 10-25 tabs opens). The size is also wonderful - with 17"" display it is a true ""lap-top"" no need to squeeze your knees together, you can sit back and work with ease! The keyboard, I didn't like at first, but when I started using it, it was very appealing and comfortable to use for the writers out there. The sensitivity is just right and the overall appearance grows on you.

I love the simple design of the laptop, not too clunky, not too flashy and just a well rounded sleek work computer. The logo is simple and not offensive and written across the laptop or in the center of the top of the screen - unlike other brands. Great as a gift or your portable work station!

,"I bought this laptop for my dad (as his first laptop). While he isn't completely computer illiterate, this would be the first computer he has ever owned. A few things that I like about this laptop:

Battery life: he's been using this laptop on his first charge for an entire week already!
SSD: solid state storage in this laptop makes it very responsive
Camera shutter: one of his biggest concerns over computers and internet was identity protection. The camera shutter was a perfect feature for him in this regard.
Size and weight: This laptop is quite thin and light weight.
Charger: the power supply for this laptop is built into the wall plug, making portability absolutely fantastic. Wish more laptop chargers came this way
HDMI port: I like that this laptop retains an HDMI port over some other display outputs. Here again, dad isn't going to want ten adapters to worry about when he wants to connect up to the TV.

Overall, I found this to be a great option, especially at the price point. It came in his favorite color and is everything he needed to get started. Only con so far has been screen brightness. It does get a little difficult for him to read on screen text on a sunny day."," July 26, 2020",5.0

It's sat out in the summer heat, the freezing temps of winter. It's been covered with dew and even frost. It gets precisely NO love or attention. I'm not even out there with it when it's working, choosing instead to operate remotely from the comfort of my home.

I don't know how good it is for gaming or whatever, or how fast, or powerful, or anything else. But I know this. You can abuse and neglect this thing and literally leave it outside 24/7/365, and it'll just keep on doing its thing."," December 4, 2021",5.0

,"A quality laptop with hardware specs that will allow the laptop to be useful for years to come. I am a computer science student, and have no issues multi-tasking my applications, some of which are resource hungry. One thing to note with this, is that you only get about 5.8gb of RAM for the operating system, I think this is because AMD utilizes 2GB of the RAM for the video card. After doing lots of shopping around, this was an extremely cost effective product. The laptop does come with some pre loaded Lenovo software, but easily uninstalled, so you have a useful computer. Do not think that because you're not spending over 1,000$ that you are not getting a nice laptop. Quad core processor with 8GB RAM is good to go for many years to come. The SSD hard drive is extremely fast, and with all my applications installed and one game, I have about 120GB hard drive space left.

The processing speed is decent for the price and worth it if you’re on a budget. I bought this mainly for online college work including editing documents, hosting video calls with multiple parties, as well as the usual web browsing and video watching. It works great for all those things, so if you’re a college student looking for a decent laptop to work on (as long as you aren’t a STEM student lol) or just someone looking to do some office work on a cheaper laptop, I’d definitely recommend you give this one a look at!

buyers beware,"I got this for my wife to replace her aging HP Core I5 machine. She could not be happier. Very thin, very light, great looking display, and the AMD Ryzen5 CPU paired with the SSD just kicks butt. I mean, it is one fast laptop for under $500. It is not used for gaming, so I couldn't testify as to how it would do with, say, World of Warcraft, but it's perfect for mundane everyday tasks. Battery life seems really good, it's been unplugged for days at a time while being used 2 or 3 hours a day & hasn't run down the battery yet. (No DVD drive, but haven't missed it - but you can get an external Dell portable here on Amazon for under $20.00.)

,"First time owning a Lenovo laptop. Pretty good overall. Setup was relatively easy. No problems.
Pros:
Memory and speed are reasonable for everyday use.
Internet surfing and Microsoft office works fine.
Battery seems to last 4 to 6 hours spending on programs used.

Cons:
Webcam quality is poor. Slight blurriness compared to other laptops I’ve used for zoom video calls.
Microphone and speaker are quiet. It has to be up to 100 volume loudness to hear others in video calls and it’s still quiet at that level.
Screen is not super bright especially if outside.
14” screen size is too small for me when trying to view emails in outlook. The whole email doesn’t fit. Wish it was at least 15”
Fan turns on pretty frequently and is moderately loud.

Overall: I would recommend it and especially at the $450 price point."," July 18, 2020",4.0
Pretty good overall,"I have used it for over 3 months now. The performance is definitely great for daily use and medium productivity, but not so good when it comes to medium or high-level gaming and content creating since it doesn't have a dedicated GPU plus the CPU isn't as good as a gaming level one, though light gaming such as Minecraft is perfectly fine. The keyboard and screen have pretty good quality. The main body is made of metal, which is nice. There's not much to complain about this device since it's really budget-friendly. The real issue that has made me hate it is that, this model is not user-upgradeable. Neither the SSD nor the RAM could be replaced if you once need more storage or more workloads."," November 17, 2020",4.0

"Pretty Good Overall, but Not Recommended :|","At first it was all well, after a while from the initial setup, the laptop kept disconnecting to the WiFi and when I tried to connect again it would rather kept saying ""connecting"" and never did, or it would not find any network at all (the WiFi was working on all other devices in the house). The problem solved when the troubleshooting reseted the Wireless Network Adapter, but it would only worked for a while. At first I thought that the problem was the outdated drivers, so I did all the available windows updates and patchs, and researched online to the best updated driver for this laptops Wireless Network Adapter, didn't work. Contacted Lenovo support but they just helped me with the updates and I decided to returned it.
I don't give it 1 star because I actually think it is a good laptop, for the price, you can't get more power than this laptops Ryzen 5 3500U/Vega 8, but the compromises to have this on a 500$ laptop is everything else that this laptop doesn't have (i.e. good screen, good webcam, fingerprint reader, nice built quality, nice port selection, USB C, touchscreen, good battery life, backlit keyboard-this laptop doesn't have any of these) The built is kinda cheap, the screen is not as terrible as the other reviews state (but don't get me wrong it's not good, I'll say it's acceptable at most), the webcam is terrible and it doest have slot of ports (doesn't have an USB C)
My conclusion: if what you want is a powerful laptop for the cheapest posible, but you are okay with compromises in other aspects, this is the one for you.
I did not buy the same one after the return, I choosed to go for a Dell Inspiron with better specs and better laptop overall, but for 150$ more (in my opinion, totally worth it)"," July 27, 2020",4.0
,"The price isn't a steal, but is a decent value.

Bought this for my son for online schooling. It gets it done. Some caveats:

-4GB is soldered to the board, and there is one slot, and it only supports 16GB
- Not a touch screen, nor.does it support a lenovo.touch pen
-USB 3.0 does not support video. You will need a Lenovo dock or some type of 3.0 displaylink video
-No.USB-C, or 3.1
It looks cool and does the job for the money. My son is able to code on Unity and VS Code runs. He's also able to use his Kamvas Pro 13 drawing tablet with no lag. Lenovo USB 3.0 dock runs the drawing tablet and a 34""curved 2k with no issues. Runs the Adobe suite, Autodesk Sketch, Steam, and Unity engine just fime.fine.

Not winning any league of legends tourneys with this, but he able to get his schoolwork done and dable into coding and computer graphics. Will be getting one for my dad as it would be a great laptop for a retiree.

"Producto excelente, coincide con lo ofertado","I bought this laptop for my daughter so she can do her school remotely during the pandemic. The webcam on this computer stopped functioning after a week of use. I set all permissions through anti-virus and in settings and I uninstalled and reinstalled the webcam driver and nothing sees it. I didn't have time to get it repaired because she needed it for school, so I bought a USB webcam so she could continue using it.
I can't fully install the software for my wifi printer on this computer, and I still can't figure out why after attempting multiple times to uninstall and reinstall. I've never had this issue on any other computer I've owned. The screen on this computer has been buggy, and I can't get the computer to save her google login information for her school; it makes her log in every single time, which is a pain in the butt.

Overall, this computer is not very impressive. I can't return it to Amazon, and the manufacturer wants me to take it to a repair facility to get the webcam fixed as if that's going to solve the other issues I have with it. Like I said before though, my kid needs it for school so I can't just not have it for a couple weeks. I just want to return it and get a new one. So many other people seemed to have luck with this computer based on the reviews, and I've owned other Lenovo computers that have been OK, so perhaps my experience with this machine is an outlier."," November 23, 2020",4.0
,"I love how people write 3 or 4 star reviews on something and compare them to high end products. IF I paid 7 or 8 hundred for this, I'd be a bit more harsh in the review.
BUT...it's a very nice mid $400s computer. Camera has a physical cover. Touch pad is very nice compared to others I've had to deal with. Processor, RAM, SSD are plenty speedy for it's intended purpose. The blue plastic is.....plastic. But fit and finish is great....not seeing a downside that it's not 'premium metal case'. (As long as we don't drop it?) Overall, very pleased. My only gripe would be the bloat software, but that's ALL compys out of the box, not just this one. And Windows is probably the worst offender so it doesn't matter which brand you get if it's Windows 10. Anyway, it's awesome."," July 27, 2020",4.0
,"I gave this to my daughter just over 5 months ago to use as her gaming computer (Minecraft, Fortnite, Among Us, Roblox). It worked BEAUTIFULLY for 5 months until one day out of nowhere, we, too, got the black screen of death that so many others have. It was still running, but the screen was black and my cursor had a spinning circle next to it. I am pretty good with computers so I tried all the usual fixes, and nothing worked. I’d always end up right back at the black screen.
BUT - I kept trying and I’m happy to report that I FIXED IT!!!

I opened a warranty claim with Lenovo & scheduled an appointment at Best Buy, but then after reading other reviews here, it was clear that this is a common problem. So I headed to YouTube. There’s a channel called PC Monkey & he has videos to walk you through all the troubleshooting for this problem. I tried all of the easy ones, but none worked. I ended up following his instructions for a fresh install of Windows from a USB - and lo and behold the laptop is like new again! It only took about 30 minutes to complete the process, and you will need another computer + a flash drive to download the install file.

I probably will not buy another Lenovo after this experience. I hope this review helps someone else who runs into the same problem."," June 3, 2021",4.0
"Defective, had to return.","I have to say, I am very surprised by this laptop. I got it for my last year of college, which is rather demanding on a laptop given it is for computer science. While this laptop certainly won't win any style contests (very plain), it is functionally hard to beat for the price. Additionally, I was very surprised to see it doesn't contain a standard SSD, but rather an nVME chip.

I haven't tried gaming on it, but I regularly run multiple VMs for development and testing. This has aced every expectation in that regard. As an added bonus, it is very slim - only a hair thicker than my HP 14 Chromebook. Battery quality seems so-so, but that is par for the course with any x86 laptop."," January 18, 2021",4.0

The Perfect 14” Laptop For Me!,"All in all, if you weigh quality more you should probably pay 50-100 bucks more for laptop with similar characteristics but better built-in-quality. Also take into consideration that if battery life and working outdoors (brightness issue) is important for you this laptop is especially not good for you. But if you want very affordable laptop with descend performance and can turn blind eye to some of its important drawbacks which I described in detail below then this laptop is probably the best choice in the market now.

Limitations of this laptop in descending order of importance:
- The worst thing is brightness. Using this laptop outdoors is really hard because its maximum brightness is not decent.
- Battery life is not great;
- Sound volume is a little bit low;
- This is not really a problem but it just irritates me that processor fan turns on very often. It means that materials do not have high thermal conductivity as they are probably cheap;
- And of course cheap plastic;

Pros:
- Technical characteristics of this laptop are quite descend;
- Nice design.
- Very affordable for its specs;"," June 26, 2020",5.0

The specs are a bit off, this has a silent ssd drive which is almost worth it to begin with. Classic brushed blue metal look makes it aesthetically pleasing.

I’d imagine you could do some light, non graphics heavy gaming, but as a workbook for my purposes, it’s perfect. Keyboard is not backlit and the only negative I’d say is the touchpad wo independent buttons, but that just takes getting used to.

I registered the device with lenovos site and filed a claim. I was sent an email advising they don't cover damage covered by the owner (I had also attached proof of both chargers and images showing the laptop with no physical damage) and providing a number for ""billable repair"". No further info or options to discuss. Just a 'we determined it's on you we will not discuss it and here's where you pay us'

The process for finding a charger was a nightmare (done thru the lenovo site) and the email response I received to my claim was honestly infuriating. Since only number they provided for follow up was to pay for a repair I went to Hp's website and purchased a new computer (a great experience btw)

You are stuck with 4 gb which is MORE than enough for the chromebook in my honest opinion. This Acer laptop overall is an average size laptop and the specification are not bad for chromebook standards. This laptop is relatively thin and not too heavy so it is something you can take on the go with you. It is a decent laptop for a college student for sure. It has (in my opinion) the same standard chromebook processor (pentium). The ram is 4 gb which is standard for a chromebook. It will definitely work for most daily usage. That being said, it is pretty good on battery life. It has been lasting me 8 hours every day (max 10 hours) even after the constant charging it still holds up pretty well. The cooling is good and the fan is not super loud or anything. It is a standard type c charger which can make it easier to replace in the future if needed. The power brick works well and charge pretty quickly. Upon boot up of the acer laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick considering it is just a standard chromebook. The setup is pretty straight forward and does require a google account in order to complete the setup. The bloatware is not too terrible. The laptop also has only a 14 inch screen with the max resolution at 1366 x 768. The screen is not bad brightness but not the best quality. It still keep the traditional two USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing and can go all the way around considering you can use it like a tablet. Although I am not a fan of the keyboard always being in the back. I feel like it could get caught and it will get stuck which is annoying. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the bright silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but can feel a bit cheap. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It does show some wear after a few months use if you use it a lot. It leaves that ""spot"" eventually. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it. The dual microphone makes for a very clear voice and I have not had any issues with any sound issues. It usually does not pick up too much surrounding noise and focuses more on voice. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three hours to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long and the charger does get hot so handle with care. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but the bloatware has to go so I would recommend you uninstall that if possible. The speaker system is okay but honestly not top of the line. The processing speed is not and it works for what I need. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is works for your basic every day use. I am unsure if you can install linux on it but chrome works just fine on this. You get a smaller screen but it is perfect for every day use. The acer laptop does not run too hot (slightly warm) and the battery life is not bad. The specification is not bad at 4 GB ram and 128 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what I need it for. The hinge is not bad and the touch screen is good. I am just not a fan of the keyboard being on the back as it is a little cheap feeling and if gets caught on anything it might break off."," February 18, 2023",4.0

"Kept shutting down if moved, battery wouldn't charge","The good:
- I'm impressed with the battery life, still going strong even when watching a few hours of video. Exceeds expectations.
- Seems to handle web apps with ease. Boots up very quickly.
- USB 3 charging. Yes, thank you! It makes finding a charger really easy, even if I forget it at home. Charges quickly, too.
- For cloud, 128GB is totally sufficient. MicroSD extension allows for even more flexibility.
- Not too heavy. And being able to convert it to tablet mode comes in handy when walking around with it.

The mediocre:
- When watching video, you have to look directly at the screen. If you are looking at an angle the picture gets washed out. It makes it difficult to watch while being active. The resolution isn't great, but for $300 I shouldn't expect much more than that anyway.
- The touchpad isn't great. I might be spoiled by my Macbook, though, which costs several times more than this, so I probably need to temper my expectations.

The bad:
- Bluetooth, for some reason, comes with a slight delay. Annoying when watching certain videos. I tried with several pair and that delay just wouldn't go away.

I find myself using this more than I thought I would, which means for $300 it way exceeds expectations. It isn't for everybody, nor for every application."," July 18, 2022",4.0
,"Because this laptop is convertible, at this price point it's quite a bargain.

I would spend a little more and get it with 8GB.

PRO
-Touch screen
-Pretty good, but not great keyboard feel
-Convertible format
-WiFi 6 (you will probably notice a difference if your router supports 6)
-Two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports | and 1 HDMI Port
-Fine for maybe 60% of what most people do with a computer (i.e., not gaming, modeling, machine learning, CAD.)

CON
-No RJ45 ethernet port
-Not FHD (not 1920 x 1080) (FHD vs. HD is a bit of a misnomer, not an Acer problem)
-You will need a USB hub if you use external mouse & keyboard (recommended by me if you type fast & want speedy screen actions)
-Keyboard is not backlit
-Not enough RAM (see image).

CONSIDERATIONS
-Do you really want a Chromebook? There's a lot to like in the simplicity and reduced attack surface for the Chromebook, but there will be edge conditions where you'll think, ""I used to be able to do that with Windows.""
-Maybe you'd be happier with a Linux box plus desktop manager. It would feel, in some respects, like a cowboy version of MacOS: fast and heavily customizable.
-This Chromebook has many constraints in order to be this cheap. One is the Intel integrated graphics. It won't do some things beyond ordinary browser and Google Docs editing very well.
-Expect to eventually spend another 50.00-150.00 to exploit the benefits of the USB-C hub - though not necessary right away."," June 12, 2022",4.0
"Convertible + WiFi 6 is great, but needs more RAM.","This chromebook laptop is a basic, no frills computer that doesn’t have a ton of storage and isn’t amazingly fast, but it is good for doing school work and streaming tv and movies. It only has 4GB of RAM, which is less than ideal, especially for the current price tag. If you are a big gamer, I probably would not recommend this chromebook, but all I needed was just something that was easy to use and I could do work on and watch Netflix. This has been working well so far and is lightweight and has a decent sized screen. It’s a great option for college for writing papers. This can be converted from a laptop to a tablet, and the screen flips easily. The touch screen is responsive, but slightly less responsive than my other tablet.

,"This review is for Acer Chromebook Spin 314 Convertible Laptop CP314-1H-P9G7. I’m going to divide this review up into sections: Pros, Cons, Final Thoughts.

Pros:
The construction seems decent. The hinges seem solid, and the screen seems durable. This Chromebook is convertible, and the touchscreen works well. The trackpad is also very good. The battery life is surprisingly good. Good keyboard layout. All the main connections are here, including HDMI, USB-C, and it has a memory card slot. The audio is technically neutral, but I put in pros since it wasn’t bad.

Cons:
It’s a Chromebook, so you need to be connected to the Internet to do anything. Chrome OS, so you have limitations on what you can run. Keyboard is not backlit. Not enough RAM, in fact my three-year-old cellphone has far more RAM than this Chromebook does. Only a 720p resolution, and it could be a better quality display. This thing is on the heavy side, however that is the trade-off of the thick Gorilla glass, solid construction, and large battery.

Final Thoughts:
The only reason to get a Chromebook over a laptop is to meet a tight budget. However, you can actually buy quality laptops for less, and you can buy convertible touchscreen ones for about the same price as this Chromebook. But all of those other options include more RAM, memory, and better screens. So, where does that leave this Chromebook then? It leaves it in the dust. I couldn’t recommend this Chromebook over a laptop to anyone at this price point. A Windows laptop is going to have far more software options than a Chromebook, and you don’t have to be connected to the Internet to do everything."," August 12, 2022",4.0
Not Bad,"I’ll be honest. I’m not really a tech person so I won’t be able to give a technical analysis of this computer. I ordered this computer for my son for college. Although this wasn’t necessarily what he wanted he was fine with using it until he was able to get what he wanted.

He has been using it for the last two months plus and seems to like it pretty well. He does not do any gaming on it but he does store music on it. He says that the screen quality and functionality of it is fine for what he uses it for. He does like the flip function which makes it versatile while using.

He did have a complaint about the battery life and feels that could improve. Overall he feels it is pretty decent for his needs."," July 24, 2022",4.0
,"TL;DR: This computer is fine for a secondary device, but I would not recommend this to someone who is looking to travel with this or use this as their sole computer based on poor value and possible quality concerns.

Acer has always been a value brand to me, but one that makes decent enough hardware to justify buying it. The Spin 314, unfortunately, doesn't satisfy being a good value nor am I particularly pleased about the quality.

Value: The Spin 314 comes with a Pentium N6000, which is fine as it's a Chromebook, but the 4gb of ram is somewhat limiting for what is nearly a $400 laptop, at the time of writing. 4gb of ram is fine if your intention is to stay on Chrome, but now with Android applications, you'll really want 8gb as it can fill up fast with multiple open. The screen is the next poor item for value ...

Screen: The 1366x768 screen, for those that aren't aware, is found on lower-end laptops in the $200-300 range and means that the resolution of the screen will look far worse than a full HD screen (1920x1080). This makes things seem more jagged, most noticeably text. The screen panel doesn't seem all that bad, not the best with dark colours but otherwise is a good 768p screen. At this price, I would've liked to see FHD.

Build quality: My unit seems to have issues with the bottom of the screen being pressed on too hard at the bottom of the display as small pressures applied to the laptop, like even typing, make the bottom display warp as if you were pressing on it. Which isn't how most touchscreen laptops I've come across handle.

Keyboard and Trackpad: The keyboard is actually a highlight for me, I think it does a great job with key feel and travel; Acer keyboards are usually pretty good on the market. The trackpad was not a great spot for me, with mouse acceleration you must go very slow otherwise you will be guessing where your cursor lands on the screen. Without mouse acceleration, it feels sluggish, like it's a millisecond behind or something. I imagine the trackpad will be fine for most consumers though.

Battery: In my experience, watching YouTube and browsing websites has been around 6 hours - which for me is decent enough as most other laptops under $500 have 3-4 hours for me.

Port selection is pretty good and overall ChromeOS has evolved quite a bit for a laptop of this nature to be a good secondary, or if you have limited needs, to be your only computer."," June 19, 2022",4.0
nice,"Having used many different Chromebooks, this one has a lot of ports, which is great to have. But the screen quality is so-so and the trackpad is nice."," June 24, 2022",4.0
,"I got this to use in bed for my home business. Its very portable and easy to use, I like that I can flip the screen over to turn it into a writing tablet to take notes. Its a little heavier than my last Chromebook so I installed a laptop swivel arm behind my bedpost so I can lay down and still type on a stable surface and keep the vent fans off the fabric of my comforter and bedsheets.

The Chromebook is really sleek and slim for easy travel, I am really happy with this laptop, it has well exceeded my expectations for a portable PC workstation."," June 13, 2022",4.0
FANTASTIC chromebook,"So I like the design and form of this Chromebook. It has a nice keyboard, and excellent touchpad, and some decent guts that let you do everything from office productivity to some android gaming. The app store(s) have increased in size quite a bit since Chromebook was introduced to the world, and being able to run many Android apps gives you a lot of options, even offline.

My only complaint is that the HD version I got has some really tight viewing angles. When you tilt too far, you start to see the screen colors inverting. It's really beautiful straight-on, and that's how you'll use it 90% of the time, but my advice would be to pay the extra for the FHD or 4K screen. It's worth it.

Five stars, but with a caveat that this version's screen should only be chosen for straight-on viewing."," June 6, 2022",4.0

,"Our son set this up in less than 30 min and was able to start working on his homework with it. He likes the touch screen and most of the kids in his 7th grade class have Chromebook laptops. I would suggest going with more expensive FHD version as the 1080 HD isn't as sharp as what's more standard these days. Processing power is more than enough to do everything he needs to in 7th grade. Of course he also uses to play Minecraft as well and says it works well for that. All his Bluetooth devices, mouse headset, etc. work great with it.

,"This review is for the Acer Chromebook 4GB / 128GB / 14"" HD model. When comparing this to other Chromebook options available with similar specs, this is priced a bit high. However, I like it's smooth operation, slim design and vibrant display. This model has 4gb of RAM, which is a little low -8gb would be much better. Still, this is slim, lightweight and very easy to travel with. The keyboard could be better and it doesn't feel ""premium"". There's a lot to like about this Chromebook and some cons as mentioned, but I think you could do better at this current price point ($371 at the time of this review)."," June 29, 2022",4.0
Great Chromebook,"If you're looking for a Chromebook and are considering this one, I would keep looking unless Acer cuts the price in half. The product page says it has an HD screen, but then you look closer and see that the resolution is only 1366 X 768. While technically you can say this is HD, when most people see those 2 letters, they automatically think the resolution is Full HD, which is 1920 X 1080. It has been a long time since I saw any laptop being sold with a resolution below Full HD. Also, it only comes with 4GB of RAM. For almost $400, it needs to have at least 8GB. I think the reason for the high price is the fact that it has a convertible touch screen, so you can use it like a tablet if you wish. That still doesn't justify the high price to me given the other mediocre specs. Even when I was typing on the keyboard, it felt cheap to me. Not a quality keyboard at all and not even close to other Acer laptops I have used. I would give this Chromebook a better rating if it was selling for $200 or less, but for almost $400 it's just not worth it. If you're going to spend that much I recommend getting a regular Windows 11 laptop."," June 23, 2022",4.0
,"Our 17yo daughter, who's not super computer-centered, had no problem setting this up and getting going. Very nice format, compact and powerful."," August 30, 2022",4.0
Great for school,"I've been using this chromebook for about a month now, and it's holding up great! One thing I like is that once I logged into my google account, all my previous settings from my old chromebook automatically uploaded (browser theme, desktop background, icon, bookmarks, etc.) It was nice not to have to go through the set up process again, it made for a seamless transition after my old laptop broke. I've had a chromebook for years, so it was nice to see the consistency across different computers. It felt like an upgraded version of my beloved late laptop, so the transition was painless. I had no trouble adjusting to this one (other than learning the touch screen differences, since my old laptop didn't have a tablet mode).
The hinges for the screen are very sturdy, I transition it to the 'tablet' version all the time and I haven't had any trouble with that. I don't need to go get an ipad with this computer, it serves well as both a laptop and a tablet. The touch screen works fairly well, if a bit slow when I scroll. That is one of the small issues. It's not too bothersome, but I wish it was a pinch faster.
Also, it's interesting that the user interface changes when you go to tablet mode. It will automatically switch once you pull the screen back, so it transitions well between laptop to tablet. Things like opening the apps screen and changing tabs have an intuitive set of commands, once you figure it out. For example, the tabs aren't always visible at the top of the screen, you have to drag down to see them, which definitely makes the difference between tablet and laptop more obvious. It is nice, feels like you're getting two different experiences in one package.
When in tablet mode, you can go into portrait mode, like a cell, or stay in landscape like a computer. It will automatically adjust. I did not find a portrait lock mode, which was a little bothersome if you move around and it flip flops. That is one of the small issues, but it could be fixed with a software update and ultimately doesn't bother me too much. Also, the physical keyboard is disabled when in tablet mode so no need to worry about accidentally typing when you adjust. The onscreen touch screen keyboard is alright, but I don't like to use it for much other than typing in a website. If I want to chat or write, I definitely prefer the physical keyboard.
The screen resolution is great, very crisp. I find it to be a bit too blue/cool tinted, though, and it hurts my eyes after a while. I am prone to migraines so I am very sensitive to things like that. I turned on the night mode which somewhat helps, but it does lean very orange. I have it set to about 25% warmth which does help the eyestrain without distorting the colors too much, so it's not a huge issue. 100% warmth is just straight up orange though so I don't think I'd ever go that far. I'm sure it's not bad for typing on a plain white document, but I'd never watch videos like that.
In terms of videos, it has a good screen resolution and handles 1080p very well, and hasn't had any issues with either the quality of the screen or the cpu lagging with high definition. It has enough RAM to support many open tabs and I haven't noticed any lagging even when I have 20+ tabs open, including having youtube on in the background, research tabs sitting open, while also scrolling social media. It can handle a good workload, for sure. Obviously since its a chromebook it is not suited for gaming. I already have a PC desktop for stuff like that though, so I don't expect that from a laptop. Its perfect for casual browsing, watching tv in bed, listening to music and taking it on the go for classes/working in a cafe/library.
It works well for a student, music listener, and avid browser of the internet (sometimes, all at once. Shhhh, dont tell my professors ;).
Speaking of music, it has great speakers. I like that they are located next to the keyboard, because it is always irritating when the speakers are under the computer and the sound gets muffled if it's on my bed/lap. The audio quality is very crisp, I can hear all the instruments when I listen to prog rock, all the layered beats with edm, and even make out muffled dialogue in movies (side note; what's up with the trend toward quiet speaking in movies? It's so irritating. At least its not too bothersome with this though!). It is also surprisingly loud! At full volume, it fills the room and can be heard through a closed door. Definitely loud enough to have music playing and still be audible/crisp over regular indoor conversation volume. I'm impressed with the speakers.
I like the keyboard, it's the standard type for chromebooks (I think, at least it is the same as my last one! I am not sure if there is a difference between brands, though). The keys are fairly quiet but with just enough springiness to be satisfying. As a student I have to type a lot, and I have always had a good experience with this. I would use a keyboard cover in class, but even if I didn't have one it wouldn't be rudely loud, just maybe a little annoying to my neighbors.
The mousepad is well situated so you can have your wrists resting on the sides without accidentally setting it off (at least for standard touch typing styles! If you're a one finger hunt and poke, then idk what to say lol).
I do have two small issues with the mousepad though. One, the 'ocean glass' feature is starting to rub off and it's not as smooth as when I first got the computer. It doesn't impact the functionality, but it does feel less luxurious now. I miss it :( Another issue is that sometimes, the tap-to-click stops working. When that happens, I have to press until it audibly clicks, which I hate. It is fixed by restarting the computer though, so it doesn't seem like a permanent issue. I am concerned that one day it will stop working for good, though. Fingers crossed that doesn't happen! This has been the most annoying thing so far.
I like the function keys across the top above the numbers, they are very useful and I especially appreciate that you don't have to use the function button to activate them! I tend to use the one that shows all the tabs and apps you have open a lot, I find that very useful. There's also the refresh, back button (to go to a prev page), full screen, brightness, volume, and lock button. One thing I like about this is that its a lock button, not a power button like my old chromebook. The power button is a physical button on the side, by the hdmi input. There is also one on the opposite side for volume, which is really useful for the tablet orientation. I think buttons are underrated these days so that was a nice surprise.
It has all the basic ports one might need. Two standard usb, which is good if you need to have a mouse and a usb stick. There's also the hdmi and headphone jack, a micro sd (which I don't use, so I can't speak to the quality) and the usb-c charging port. They all function well.
The charger works well, I like that they've gone with the standardized usb-c. It doesn't take too long to charge, maybe an hour? I haven't timed it, but I find that to be a good sign that I'm not constantly checking how long it will take. Even 15 minutes is enough to give it enough juice to carry you through a few episodes when you feel like hanging out on the couch instead of the desk. I leave it plugged in while I take an intermission and get snacks and that is enough to carry me through another round of netflix.
One of the bigger issues is the webcam quality is not great. It's pixelated and the colors kind of shimmer/fluctuate? It's hard to explain, but even in standard interior lighting it is blurry. It's alright for zoom calls, but I wouldn't use it to take pictures or anything. If you spend a lot of time on camera, it may be worth it to get an attachable webcam. However, I don't spend much time on zoom at all, prefer to avoid it at all costs tbh, so I'm not too bothered by it. Also, who needs to look perfect for an online lecture? Nobody cares that much, so ultimately it doesn't bother me too bad.
Ultimately you do have to deal with the limitations of a chromebook (web access only, no downloadable programs/word processors/games/other browsers) but that's just how it is with chromebooks, so if you've already decided to go with chrome then you just gotta accept that its a compromise you gotta make. It is one of the tradeoffs for the price point, which I obviously don't have a problem with considering this is my second chromebook.
Google docs, slides, and spreadsheets work fine for regular use, nothing to write home about, we've all used them. It is nice that all my documents are easily shared because everyone uses google docs these days regardless of which UI they have on their own computer, so I don't have to transfer them from word. Eventually I might have to buy more storage space (or delete some old essays from high school, quite the tragedy I know) since everything is stored on google's cloud not local files. I've had my account for a very long time though, and I'm still only on 10 of 15 gigs, so they do give you a very reasonable amount of storage for basic usage. I think you can have local files, but if so it's not intuitive to use them and I haven't really tried.

Overall, this is a great basic computer that works for all my needs, and the small issues I mentioned do not detract from the functionality and usage. I would recommend this, it's a solid laptop for the price and would work well for any student/casual internet user."," July 4, 2022",4.0

Easy to use,"So far I like this. I just set it up yesterday. I should have realized that Gorilla glass would mean the screen is just like my phone - there is a lot of glare. My old Chromebook had an anti-glare screen, which I much prefer. Oh well - that's my bad.

Also you would think in 2023 the webcam would come with a privacy slider, but it does not.

Love the touch screen to zoom in on stuff.

I don't know about the battery life yet, but I expect it to last longer than my old one, which was about 6-8 hours.

Battery life 2 weeks in looks maybe 3-4 hours which has been par for me. 16 GB Ram 11 slams the memory (92% yesterday) with about 100 tabs open in Chrome, unlike my 5-year old Windows 10, 16 GB Lenovo. This is not an issue with this PC but simply Windows 11 consumes at least 2-3 GB more RAM than Windows 10, so 16GB barely cuts it for me. I found a ""tab suspender extension"" which does help with some of the memory issues and makes it workable. However, I only exchanged this because I do use a lot of Chrome tabs, and I found the same model model with 32 GB RAM. When searching, that upgrade seems to be mostly grand more when filtering through Amazon, but I found basically the same model with 32 GB RAM for only $150 more. I found it on laptopmedia dotcom which links to Amazon. I just received it, and it's the exact same laptop except double the RAM."," January 14, 2023",1.0

Multiple times a day. Even just using MS Word, it suddenly highlights any text, switches to all caps, and has to be restarted to perform properly for a couple of hours.

,"Wow the screen looks amazing and the finishes are all high end. It was very easy to setup, maybe 15-20 min with updates, account setup and passwords if you already have a Microsoft outlook account. The 16gb of RAM will make this fly through any tasks and the 1tb hard drive is way more than I’ll need anytime soon.
Verified it works with a generic old USB-C dock as pictured.
The only thing it’s missing is an Ethernet port if you want to go hardwired so you would need an adapter or use it through the dock if you have one.
It’s great they were able to fit a 10 key on this but it is a bit on the small size as seen from my fingers on all the keys.
They say this is lightweight but I had to check it with my scale because it felt way more 5lbs. I was surprised, it weighed in at 4lb 10oz.

3. The Computer is Used, not New.
4. There was no Manual

On 5/6, I called Lenovo's Ideapad Technical Support for IdeaPad, this call was made at 6:45pm EST. I spoke to Joy. Joy stated that the Manufacturer sold the computer to this seller on 3/3/22 and was sold without a Warranty. A fact not represented on this Seller's Page. Also, Joy stated that there was no possibility of purchasing an Extended Warranty from Lenovo. I asked Joy, what the classification of this machine was, that being NEW, USED, REHAB. Joy stated this computer was "" Used"" and identified that way from Lenovo. That being Said, I was misled by the Seller. I will add, the Computer does look "" Brand New"" and appears to be in like New Condition. The Computer seems to be functioning very well, however, again, NO WARRANTY!

I'll start by saying I like Chromebooks, cheap, reliable, solid state, regular updates. That's the good stuff. The not so good stuff is the message that loaded onto the startup screen that said to powerwash it first. I'd never seen that. I thought it was strange, and as time went on, I thought maybe this Lenovo is a refurb. It came in a Lenovo box, with all the Lenovo stickers and bar codes. but was packed, no, tossed into a box that half a dozen would have fit inside along with about 15 inches of brown packing paper -thanks for a 5th rate packing job D&H Distributing. It rattled and thumped back and forth inside the shipping box such that I thought there must be pieces crashing around in there. I told the driver as much, and he took off immediately.
It ran seriously slow at first. I couldn't figure it out. Checked the wifi router, hooked into the ethernet with an adapter, there isn't one on the Lenovo, ran a few other tests thinking it would have to be something external, brand new out of the box Chromebook. But then I remembered the suggestion on the start up screen.
I powerwashed it. That helped. I found and deleted cookies. That helped some more. Then I started digging. I found extensions I don't use, website addresses I don't visit, and tasks I have never heard of running in the background. Powerwashing didn't get them. I eliminated all those things, powerwashed it again and the performance was much better but not nearly what it should be. Amazon streaming is iffy, but Amazon and Google have running battles we get caught up in, YouTube buffers regularly, pressing the forward or reverse keys helps on both issues, but i understand it is a $150 unit. I don't expect the speed and precision of my Apple stuff, but I was under the impression I was buying a new Chromebook, and it may be new, but someone else left their sites on it.
I got mine from D&H Distributing in Illinois. I'm going to keep it for the price alone, but be advised: if you get a notice to powerwash on startup, do it. Then start running down the footprints. Run the task manager, the cookie cutters, and check with 'about Chrome' in the settings. Then powerwash it again. But don't get too confident that you have it clean. Some of the things I learned herein are powerwashing doesn't get everything, it is possible to get a new computer someone else has used, and it is possible to get a refurb sold as new."," August 31, 2019",2.0

Second was I purchased a turtle beach headset for gaming on my xbox and on the box of the headset it said update software before you play.

Its a chromebook,"TL;DR: If you're an average user who just browses the internet, uses social media, checks and sends email, uses a few apps, does school or work projects from home, or watches YouTube/streams shows, this Chromebook is for you!

PROS:

Fast boot up and shut down times
Easy automatic updates
Can't get viruses
It comes preloaded with all the basic apps for free
Smooth and fast web browsing
Very little to no lag while using one app and one or a few tabs at a time
Good build quality
Long battery life
Good size and very portable
Clear and bright basic screen
Good sound quality from the speakers
Expandable storage via SD card slot
Big multi-touch touchpad
Well spaced chicklet keyboard

CONS:

Very limited ports including only one USB port
Screen is only HD (720p)
Very limited built-in storage
Basic processor and limited RAM
No touch screen
No backlit keyboard

Bottom line: If you don't play video games, edit photos/video/audio/etc, if you aren't a power user who uses multiple apps and multiple tabs at one time, then this device is for you. If you're an average everyday user, for the price, this device is really good."," December 4, 2021",2.0
,"On the good side: I received the laptop very quickly it reached me within -+ a week to Israel which was a pleasant surprise. The Chromebook is a new experience for me I normally use a Windows machine. I purchased it for my parents who need a simple laptop for everyday tasks. From my short experience it fits the bill. It is quick, very simple to set up and use. Somewhere between an Android smartphone and a laptop. On the bad side: I attached a photo of the SD card that is used to extend the internal memory. Well, it goes in only half way. I am afraid it would easily break. I tried to contact the Amazon Product support but they only accept local US numbers and I live in Israel and own an Israeli cell phone and land line. Go figure. Another con for us bilingual keyboard users is there is no shortcut keys like in Windows for Chrome OS (Alt+Shift) and you need to go to the bottom of the screen to change keyboard from language to language.
please help with that SD card sticking out of the laptop.
Edit July 29 2019: After checking with Amazon and looking at an online video on YouTube the SD card is supposed to stick out. I see it as a design flaw as it can easily break. That said the laptop itself is excellent very quick and answers all my parents needs. We like it

It's a chromebook- No Itunes and not compatible with some college required recording devices,"This Chromebook is outstanding - perfect reminder of what a Chromebook should be (cheap, long battery, zippy web browsing, worry free usage, optimized port selection). The size is right, the keys feel great, the track pad is fine. The screen resolution is perfect for a Chromebook. I like how well this thing keeps a charge, and charges quickly. USB-C can't be beat, and it still has a headphone jack, HDMI, regular USB and a slot for SD cards. If you're in the market for a Chromebook, you can't do much better especially for the price. The previous Lenovo Chromebook I had is still kicking - I can't believe how much value I get out of a sub-$180 laptop. Just wanted something a little bigger than the 11"" Chromebook I already had. Perfect for traveling.

Keep in mind:
- Not a PC or a Mac (if that is really truly what you think you want or need, look elsewhere and expect to spend 3x)
- Do you research about what a Chromebook actually is. All you 1, 2, and 3 star reviewers complaining that its not a PC or Macbook look like goobers in your reviews. It's essentially a web-browser, which for most people is all you need (Facebook, Netflix, look at memes, email, pay bills online, etc.). You can even use the browser version of the Microsoft suite if you're feeling in the mood to do some work.
- Even if the price was 2x, you can't complain about the screen resolution, or the hard drive size, or the lack of back-lit keyboard.
- Plenty of RAM for what you intend to do on a Chromebook
- Not a touch-screen. Don't be surprised.

- Give me an 8GB RAM option just for kicks. 4 is fine, but RAM is cheap these days.

,"I was looking for something to do basic tasks (web, word processing and web site maintenance) this Chromebook boots fast and lets me get to work quickly. And the battery life is great; so far I’ve been able to get more than 9 hours of battery life with it.

UPDATE 11.2019 -- I stick by my review and have even taken it on a couple of business trips and used it during meetings. The battery life certainly is one of its strongest assets. As other people were plugging in laptops about 4 hours into a recent meeting I was in, I never had to reach for mine. The keyboard also is very quiet and comfortable. There isn't a lot of onboard storage for files, but I keep a couple of USB drives with me and I also have an external drive that's powered through the USB port. When I need to use a mouse, I use a Logitech blutooth model, which allows me to keep the single USB port available for the external hard drive or USB drive. I've also connected this Chromebook to an external monitor via the HDMI port with no problems -- it wasn't even necessary to configure anything as the Chromebook just recognized it was there, so I had an expanded desktop. For traveling and doing work on the road, it definitely fits my needs. The price also is tough to beat for a budget Chromebook."," August 29, 2019",2.0

This is a budget device and that's obvious from there feel of it. But that's ok with me. It's lightweight and pretty responsive. That's what I want, since this device is just for writing, some basic spreadsheet work and podcast recording. Simple enough.

So it should be clear to you, dear reader, that I'm not one of the irrational people who gets super picky people about every technical aspect of a computer, especially at such a low price point. That being said, I have one big problem with this device.

The screen resolution is so bad that the device is hard to stare at for more than a few minutes. It's unbelievably grainy, beyond what could be blamed on anti-glare protection. You can brighten the screen, but there's NO WAY to change the contrast. Come on folks, contrast is not a high end feature.

Because I don't want to deal with sending this back and I have work to do, I'm going to try to make this work. So far I installed a night mode app which did improve things a bit. Next I'll change the desktop. Fingers crossed.

,This PC is really loud when compare to a Lenovo ThinkPad or the Lenovo Chromebook. This thing when the fan blows you can hear it and also sometimes it gets really slow so I can't multitask. I mean basically it's slower than a refurbish 10 years old Lenovo ThinkPad but most time it works fine. You see I bought this thing to replace the 10 years old refurbish Lenovo for the most part it's fine but for some odd reason sometimes it gets really slow and then the Apple Music APP just stops working. It happened today so I got angry and switch back to the Lenovo ThinkPad. The way it is I think it would be better if it backs up the Lenovo ThinkPad.," March 12, 2020",5.0
On its way for repair,"I got those on prime day for sale for $145. For the price it was then I feel like it's worth it. The screen isn't great but not bad either. I really like the size. I don't think it's too small like some reviews said. That being said, I'm not wild about the Chrome OS. You can only use applications which come from the Google Play store, and not all of them are available for the laptop Chrome OS. And some function weird, or differently. Have limited functionality. Do your research to see if a ChromeBook is good enough for what you need before getting one."," August 15, 2019",5.0
,"Good value for the money. I've now had this chromebook for over a year and a half and have had no problems with it. It's light, sturdy, very comfortable to use with very decent sound, mic, camera for video conferencing. This is my 3rd chromebook, and usually after a year, the screen, mouse, keyboard, or SOMETHING starts to act up. No such issues this time around. I use it everyday, primarily for work-related tasks. The screen-size is decent, but I also have a Chromecast so I can just ""beam"" my computer onto my big screen TV whenever I want to. This is my first Lenovo device ever, and when the time comes to replace/upgrade this chromebook, I'm probably going to pick another Lenovo."," September 28, 2019",5.0
It's an OK PC,"The price is great. The screen contrast is not very good and can be difficult to see from some angles. Turning up the brightness only makes it worse. With Adobe ending flash it has made using school applications and web applications painful to use, sometimes unusable, and webcam difficult. I bought this for my kids to use for online school tasks and they have had problems because of the flash limitations. Only a single USB port.....come on guys....this Cbook doesn't have touchscreen so having only a single USB port is very limiting. It hooks up to both standard WiFi and 5G without issue. My background is with PCs and I am not a fan of the scrolling on this laptop given that it does not have a touchscreen. Hooking up a USB mouse nearly a requirement."," April 2, 2020",5.0
,"I bought this, and a few spares, for a 'don't care what happens to it' laptop for road trips, gifts, etc.

It does this. Much better than the Dell Crap-top I tried first (Inspiron 14"" something).
Sure you gotta navigate the Android enviro... but it seems to be much faster and stable than Win10.

Pretty good,"This was my first experience with Chrome OS. I'm retired now and wanted to replace a Windows 7 laptop. Only need to browse the internet, pay bills, do photos and watch movies. The biggest plus I found with Chrome OS is the quick boot up. For this particular model of chrome book, I need more screen resolution because I was constantly having to adjust the screen to see. Also need more than 32 GB storage because I learned that programs cannot be installed and run from the sd card. I returned this unit for these reasons, not because there was anything wrong with the hardware or opration of the Chromebook. I am now searching to purchase another Lenovo Chromebook, but one with better screen and more storage."," May 2, 2020",5.0
,"Based on a review on the web claiming this to be an awesome Roblox laptop for kids we picked one up for my daughter. It's basically an Android tablet in a laptop, you use the Google Play store to install apps and its all tied in to your Android account. If you use FamilyLink you get full control over the device and can manage your childs usage.
It run's android apps and games well, the hardware seems fairly sturdy if basic, for the price it's a great deal. Awesome if you want to give a child a laptop and not worry about them breaking a $1000 computer."," August 11, 2019",5.0

Two things that may considered negative (more like false negative).. 1- mouse (no separate right click button) though there is an alternate that works just fine. 2- chrome OS.

,"FURIOUS. Bought for elderly mother in April '21 but didn't activate until Sept '21 due to her hospitalization. In March '22, the machine started acting up (would turn off suddenly) until later that month the Chrome OS crashed. Contacted Lenovo's ""awesome"" customer service and they dumped it off onto Google (I get that it's a software issue), which only has web support (i.e., no human beings). Followed prompts to reinstall Chrome OS via online support but all it gave me was a black screen. Consulted online forums and tried their suggestions to no avail. Of course, since it's out of warranty (even though it was only used maybe two dozen times for about an hour each), the Chromebook is a black-screen paperweight. Several computer repair shops offered to fix for more than the machine is worth. Never again. Lenovo lost my business FOREVER.

I have always owned desktops and never ever had one issue like that ever pop up and always had same carrier for internet. this computer runs terribly, no lighted keyboard makes it impossible to use if your on it while your spouse is in bed beside you, maneuvering is hard since its always adjusting screen size by itself. I honestly hate this thing so much i am going back to a desktop, my first laptop and its absolutely everything i didnt want. keeping this in mind i researched laptops for a month before purchasing. disappointed in product, disappointed in place i ordered from."," August 14, 2016",5.0

Five Stars,"This laptop is an excellent candidate for running linux. Most distributions released in 2015 should work just fine. With linux users, the biggest challenge is finding a laptop with a well supported and stable wireless LAN card. Lenovo does not let you swap the wireless lan card as the BIOS has a whitelist of cards that are only available from lenovo which will prevent the system from booting if an unsupported card is installed. You will have to get the selection right the first time. Linux users will want a laptop with an intel wireless card. For such a critically important part, most laptops sold at retail won't have this information listed in the specification.

Luckily at the time of writing this, November 2015, Lenovo has been using an Intel 3160 wireless lan card with Bluetooth for almost all the recent builds of this PC. This is 1x1 dual band wireless AC card. Real world throughput is about 65 Mbps at medium distance, perfectly adequate for basic internet access. For transferring large files over the wireless network, performance will suffer compared to 2x2 Wireless AC. The hardwired ethernet port uses a Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 chipset which works well with Linux. The core i3 processor and integrated intel GPU has more than enough power to spare for basic internet usage, office applications and multimedia playback. However if you are gamer look elsewhere. The 4GB of RAM is a bit miserly, especially for Windows, but can be easily be upgraded without having to remove the keyboard. The hardrive included is a 1 TB Seagate Momentus SpinPoint M8. The optical drive is Philips/Lite-On DVD-RW.

This laptop has a touchpad with real physical buttons and is not a clickpad. There is bluetooth support so you can use a bluetooth mouse and not waste a USB port on wireless mouse dongle. This laptop has 1 USB 2.0 and 1 USB 3.0 connector on the left side and 1 USB 2.0 connector on the right side. There are connectors for either a VGA or a HDMI based external monitor. The headphone jack is on the right hand side. There is no input for an external microphone. There is a SD card reader on the right hand side. The integrated webcam is low resolution VGA. The display is a typical cheap 1366x768 no name TFT panel. Perfectly, adequate for basic usage but by no means high performance. The battery is a 4 cell. Enough for short term use away from the charger, but not good enough for any application where multiple hours must be spent without any power available.

Some of the bad points... There is no HDD activity light. Lenovo thought that the battery charging indicator is more important and they wanted to minimize the number of LEDs to reduce costs. The HDD activity light is handy to have to know if your system is running slow due to disk access. The plastic case has rather sharp edges that are uncomfortable. The keyboard has a rather sloppy feel, to it. Most of the other laptop keyboards I've used take a little more pressure to depress the keys. However, the worst problem with this laptop is the sound. Despite the dolby label on the case, there is nothing high fidelity about it. Lenovo simply threw a speaker somewhere in the case where it will fit. The result is hollow/echoy sounding audio that is noticeable even in voice applications. Overall the build quality is lower than Lenovos budget PC lineup for several years ago.

There are i5 and i7 intel processor model variations of this laptop out there that sell for hundreds of dollars more. That would be a complete waste of money. Your money will be better spent on a laptop with a higher tier of build quality. For an Intel i3 at the price point of the low 300 dollar range this is a decent bargain as you get a cheap laptop with a decent processor instead of a dog slow AMD or a Intel Celeron."," November 25, 2015",5.0
,"Excellent, i remember when Lenovo were a little less than impressive, but being that they bought out IBM, finally. All that has changed for the better. I mean what better way to make PC's and continue the legacy, than from the inventors of computers themselves. I like these a lot better also since they have dropped the IBM Logo, and the red (nipple, cursor) that use to plaque the middle of the keyboard. Which while I'm typing this review on it, I should say is very good. The top of the keys are concave which takes a little while to get use to (being that I'm use to using HP). But so far so good. I got an extra stick of 4gb RAM for this PC and now it flies. Remember when you upgrade to check the speed, this uses the newer 12,800-1600mhz speed. If you get anything less you may notice a slight drop in performance.

This is a good processor as anything I3, I5 and I7 are great. When you go for Pentiums or Celerons you get what you pay for. Sure they are good for basic things, but nowhere near the I series. And it shows. I will also say these processors can be found for a great price if you look around hard enough. And steer clear of AMD, they run to hot and don't hold a candle (anymore) to Intel. The screen looks good, although again I'm use to the big ole 17.3 inch screen. Something I'll just have to adapt to. This unit I found at Best Buy (yeah sorry Amazon), for 309$ plus tax. Clearance. Mainly because it's preloaded with Windows 8.1 which is fine with me. Windows 10 at the moment is an abomination, and riddled with issues. Just look at some of the reviews on it, especially the upgrade thumb drive options. So not thanks MS.

So I booted this up, keys are great, screen is good, HAS bluetooth, which some more expensive units don't even provide. Good solid build, not necessarily an eye catching laptop, just plain black, but I didn't get it for people to gawk over. Battery life leaves a little to be desired, clocking in at around 4 hrs or so, which I guess isn't to bad. And another thing that's great is you CAN upgrade anything. Still has the separate battery, and the back panel comes off. So no taking apart the whole pc, to get to what you need. Which is the way it is now with 90% of new laptops. So kudos to Lenovo for still being one of the top brands out there. And underrated because everyone wants the big brand names, everyone else gets. I've also liked Acer for years, but they don't sell much these days. Sadly. HP, Toshiba, and Dell are pretty much overrated IMO. And Macboooks, well cost about as much as an old used car. So pass on that. Anyway, this is a great laptop for a great price. So enjoy. I'm loving it thus far (20 year computer technician here).

BTW-unlike most this has a touchpad OFF button, which you will definitely need when typing. Also the trackpad click buttons seem generic, but really aren't. They are made to go down into the computer, or appear that way. Makes for little to no noise. This is NOT a defect."," October 30, 2015",5.0

I had some issues with the track pad, as once or twice a day it will decide to act on its own accord, which can be frustrating, as it usually resizes your window if you are using chrome at the time. Fortunately, the problem does not happen when using a mouse, so if you turn off the trackback (clicking F6), you should be god to go.

,"I purchased this Lenovo 3i G50 about 5 months ago (not through Amazon) for $325. I have used it regularly each day as a second computer to the tabletop we keep in our office.

The keyboard is great despite what some reviewers have said and the response is good as well. For a bargain machine I can't see it being much better. My uses are minimal, I don't need much power (I don't play games for example).

The biggest problem and the reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is that the battery totally sheets. Once fully charged I might get an hour of use on it. It's really bad.

Not to be Unplugged,"I have owned many laptops, netbooks, and currently own a macbook, as well as this Lenovo laptop that I bought a few months ago. This laptop has been an absolutely frustrating piece of equipment to use - and has greatly hindered productivity for one main reason - the keyboard. I have no clue who designed it, or what they were possibly thinking - maybe they secretly hate people and want to make our lives as difficult as possible. The keys don't work well and often skip letters when I am typing, making it impossible to type fast. The combination of very widely spaced keys that are also extremely flat also make typing a horrible experience. The mouse pad is one of the absolute worst I have ever used. First, it is physically closer to the left side of the keyboard, instead of in the middle, causing me to constantly hit the (r) click when I want to hit the (l) click. Unless I glue my eyes to the keyboard and type in slow motion - there is no way to be productive on this laptop without the utmost frustration. The only good thing I have to say about it, is that the actual hardware and programs work well. If you want to be able to type on a laptop without experiencing anxiety and/or vengeful thoughts of tearing it to pieces with a jackhammer- please don't buy this."," January 2, 2016",1.0

There are a few things wrong with this purchase, but there are goods. So the Good, Bad and the Ugly.
1. The Computer is not 512GB it's only 475GB of Ram
2. The Computer has no Warranty at All
3. The Computer is Used, not New.
4. There was no Manual
I personally called Lenovo and they advised this computer was sold with no Warranty, that being Said, I now have to buy a Warranty. On 5/6, I called Lenovo's Ideapad Technical Support for IdeaPad, this call was made at 6:45pm EST. I spoke to Joy. Joy stated that the Manufacturer sold the computer to this seller on 3/3/22 and was sold without a Warranty. A fact not represented on this Seller's Page.

,"setup instructions that appear as soon as it is powered on. I've been running Chromebooks for a few years, left the Mac crowd for better security, and now I have this problem. I'll start by saying I like Chromebooks, cheap, reliable, solid state, regular updates. That's the good stuff. The not so good stuff is the message that loaded onto the startup screen that said to powerwash it first. I'd never seen that. I thought it was strange, and as time went on, I thought maybe this Lenovo is a refurb. It came in a Lenovo box, with all the Lenovo stickers and bar codes. but was packed, no, tossed into a box that half a dozen would have fit inside along with about 15 inches of brown packing paper -thanks for a 5th rate packing job D&H Distributing. It rattled and thumped back and forth inside the shipping box such that I thought there must be pieces crashing around in there. I told the driver as much, and he took off immediately.
It ran seriously slow at first. I couldn't figure it out. Checked the wifi router, hooked into the ethernet with an adapter, there isn't one on the Lenovo, ran a few other tests thinking it would have to be something external, brand new out of the box Chromebook. But then I remembered the suggestion on the start up screen.
I powerwashed it. That helped. I found and deleted cookies. That helped some more. Then I started digging. I found extensions I don't use, website addresses I don't visit, and tasks I have never heard of running in the background. Powerwashing didn't get them. I eliminated all those things, powerwashed it again and the performance was much better but not nearly what it should be. Amazon streaming is iffy, but Amazon and Google have running battles we get caught up in, YouTube buffers regularly, pressing the forward or reverse keys helps on both issues, but i understand it is a $150 unit. I don't expect the speed and precision of my Apple stuff, but I was under the impression I was buying a new Chromebook, and it may be new, but someone else left their sites on it.
I got mine from D&H Distributing in Illinois. I'm going to keep it for the price alone, but be advised: if you get a notice to powerwash on startup, do it. Then start running down the footprints. Run the task manager, the cookie cutters, and check with 'about Chrome' in the settings. Then powerwash it again. But don't get too confident that you have it clean. Some of the things I learned herein are powerwashing doesn't get everything, it is possible to get a new computer someone else has used, and it is possible to get a refurb sold as new."," August 31, 2019",2.0

A few things that i truly dislike about it and as such i will never buy one again until they fix this is I've had three major problems with it. Problem one was in college I had an accounting class which during the final since this was in march of 2020 we all shifted to remote work. There was a recording program associated with Canvas and the chrome OS would not support it so i had to record using my phone which was silly. Second was I purchased a turtle beach headset for gaming on my xbox and on the box of the headset it said update software before you play. Well you could do that on a windows computer or a mac computer but not on a chromebook. Third was my ipad was locked out and disabled and with a windows computer i could download itunes to reset it or of course a MAC computer has it pre installed. But unless i go into Linux programming on this chromebook which is slightly complicated you can not download itunes on a chromebook. Everything else during college worked fine.

Its a chromebook,"TL;DR: If you're an average user who just browses the internet, uses social media, checks and sends email, uses a few apps, does school or work projects from home, or watches YouTube/streams shows, this Chromebook is for you!

PROS:

Fast boot up and shut down times
Easy automatic updates
Can't get viruses
It comes preloaded with all the basic apps for free
Smooth and fast web browsing
Very little to no lag while using one app and one or a few tabs at a time
Good build quality
Long battery life
Good size and very portable
Clear and bright basic screen
Good sound quality from the speakers
Expandable storage via SD card slot
Big multi-touch touchpad
Well spaced chicklet keyboard

CONS:

Very limited ports including only one USB port
Screen is only HD (720p)
Very limited built-in storage
Basic processor and limited RAM
No touch screen
No backlit keyboard

Bottom line: If you don't play video games, edit photos/video/audio/etc, if you aren't a power user who uses multiple apps and multiple tabs at one time, then this device is for you. If you're an average everyday user, for the price, this device is really good."," December 4, 2021",2.0
,"On the good side: I received the laptop very quickly it reached me within -+ a week to Israel which was a pleasant surprise. The Chromebook is a new experience for me I normally use a Windows machine. I purchased it for my parents who need a simple laptop for everyday tasks. From my short experience it fits the bill. It is quick, very simple to set up and use. Somewhere between an Android smartphone and a laptop. On the bad side: I attached a photo of the SD card that is used to extend the internal memory. Well, it goes in only half way. I am afraid it would easily break. I tried to contact the Amazon Product support but they only accept local US numbers and I live in Israel and own an Israeli cell phone and land line. Go figure. Another con for us bilingual keyboard users is there is no shortcut keys like in Windows for Chrome OS (Alt+Shift) and you need to go to the bottom of the screen to change keyboard from language to language.
please help with that SD card sticking out of the laptop.
Edit July 29 2019: After checking with Amazon and looking at an online video on YouTube the SD card is supposed to stick out. I see it as a design flaw as it can easily break. That said the laptop itself is excellent very quick and answers all my parents needs. We like it

It's a chromebook- No Itunes and not compatible with some college required recording devices,"This Chromebook is outstanding - perfect reminder of what a Chromebook should be (cheap, long battery, zippy web browsing, worry free usage, optimized port selection). The size is right, the keys feel great, the track pad is fine. The screen resolution is perfect for a Chromebook. I like how well this thing keeps a charge, and charges quickly. USB-C can't be beat, and it still has a headphone jack, HDMI, regular USB and a slot for SD cards. If you're in the market for a Chromebook, you can't do much better especially for the price. The previous Lenovo Chromebook I had is still kicking - I can't believe how much value I get out of a sub-$180 laptop. Just wanted something a little bigger than the 11"" Chromebook I already had. Perfect for traveling.

Keep in mind:
- Not a PC or a Mac (if that is really truly what you think you want or need, look elsewhere and expect to spend 3x)
- Do you research about what a Chromebook actually is. All you 1, 2, and 3 star reviewers complaining that its not a PC or Macbook look like goobers in your reviews. It's essentially a web-browser, which for most people is all you need (Facebook, Netflix, look at memes, email, pay bills online, etc.). You can even use the browser version of the Microsoft suite if you're feeling in the mood to do some work.
- Even if the price was 2x, you can't complain about the screen resolution, or the hard drive size, or the lack of back-lit keyboard.
- Plenty of RAM for what you intend to do on a Chromebook
- Not a touch-screen. Don't be surprised.

Things I'd like to see improved:
- Give me an 8GB RAM option just for kicks. 4 is fine, but RAM is cheap these days.
- Flush-mount SD Card slot"," July 17, 2019",2.0
,"I was looking for something to do basic tasks (web, word processing and web site maintenance) this Chromebook boots fast and lets me get to work quickly. And the battery life is great; so far I’ve been able to get more than 9 hours of battery life with it.

UPDATE 11.2019 -- I stick by my review and have even taken it on a couple of business trips and used it during meetings. The battery life certainly is one of its strongest assets. As other people were plugging in laptops about 4 hours into a recent meeting I was in, I never had to reach for mine. The keyboard also is very quiet and comfortable. There isn't a lot of onboard storage for files, but I keep a couple of USB drives with me and I also have an external drive that's powered through the USB port. When I need to use a mouse, I use a Logitech blutooth model, which allows me to keep the single USB port available for the external hard drive or USB drive. I've also connected this Chromebook to an external monitor via the HDMI port with no problems -- it wasn't even necessary to configure anything as the Chromebook just recognized it was there, so I had an expanded desktop. For traveling and doing work on the road, it definitely fits my needs. The price also is tough to beat for a budget Chromebook."," August 29, 2019",2.0

I contacted LENOVO, they didnt know what happened, they gave me some steps to follow didnt work. I leave the laptop alone for a couple of days while LENOVO contact me for additional support, and suddenly it start working again, no issue at all, everything is perfect.

My last chromebook lasted about 6 years before I had to replace it, so this is a true disappointment that this one is having issues within one month of purchase.

Strange - SD goes in only half way into slot,"Okay I just set up this device. This is my first Chromebook, but I've been using my tablet primarily for a month or so and concluded that don't need to deal with clunky windows.

This is a budget device and that's obvious from there feel of it. But that's ok with me. It's lightweight and pretty responsive. That's what I want, since this device is just for writing, some basic spreadsheet work and podcast recording. Simple enough.

So it should be clear to you, dear reader, that I'm not one of the irrational people who gets super picky people about every technical aspect of a computer, especially at such a low price point. That being said, I have one big problem with this device.

The screen resolution is so bad that the device is hard to stare at for more than a few minutes. It's unbelievably grainy, beyond what could be blamed on anti-glare protection. You can brighten the screen, but there's NO WAY to change the contrast. Come on folks, contrast is not a high end feature.

Because I don't want to deal with sending this back and I have work to do, I'm going to try to make this work. So far I installed a night mode app which did improve things a bit. Next I'll change the desktop. Fingers crossed.

Great for Daily Use,"We bought this Lenovo Chromebook for our daughter (mandatory at her middle school), and the battery failed to hold a charge and the Chromebook won't operate unless plugged in. We sent it back to Lenovo for repair and it came back with the repair ticket stating the battery has been replaced. In the meantime, while it was getting ""repaired"", the warranty ran out. I contacted Lenovo to let them know the Chromebook battery is still not working properly and they informed me the warranty has run out, so I must contact a local service center and pay for repairs. I contested the warranty claim, since it still had the same problem as before, so therefore it was not fixed and it should still be ""under warranty"" with the original repair claim date. I was given another phone number to call, which subsequently does not work. I'd stay away from this particular product and Lenovo."," June 20, 2020",5.0

,"I did buy this laptop (ultrabook) which arrived sooner than expected, delivered by DHL. Unpacking was easy. It was partially charged. I did branch it and it was fully charged very quickly. Initial windows configuration was rather fast. I installed only a few programs, such as Microsoft Office and few additional ones related to my work.
1. Battery life: I am really impressed with the battery life of this computer. After two days of installing software and dealing with minor configuration adjustments, I charged it completely and I left it playing YouTube music non-stop, after changing power & sleep configuration to leave it functioning with no interruption. The computer played YouTube during 10:30 hours. I was really impressed. The I charged it completely in the next day. It took 1:40 h to be completely charged, Awesome.
2. Display: I am maybe somewhat naif, but I have never had a display experience such as with this computer. It gives you a sort of a '3D image'. Incredible. I showed it to my wife to be sure of what I was seeing, and she told me she had the same perception as well. Very nice. YouTube good recordings have an excellent resolution on screen.
3. Keyboard: although the layout of the keyboard is a 'classical' LeNovo layout, its touching is really smooth, with a kind of a rubbering sensation at the fingers. Typing is very responsive. The only thing I didn't like is that LeNovo switched the positions of Ctrl and Fn keys. In my previous (still in use and very good) LeNovo Flex 5, the position of these two keys are inverted. Why LeNovo did this?
4. Touchpad: the touchpad is incredibly responsive as well. Smooth and pleasant to touch. However, be aware to have clean hands before using the computer. After a few days, the touchpad had a greasy spot in it which is not easy to clean. This is maybe of my fault.
5. Web browsing: I don't like Microsoft Edge very much (although I have to try it again). Therefore, I downloaded and installed Chrome. Browsing the web with Chrome is very fast.
6. USB ports: the ultrabook has two USB ports. Transferring a folder of 62.2 Gb with 304 movie files from a Toshiba Canvio Connect II 1TB Portable Hard Drive to the ultrabook took 8 min. 23 sec.. Transferring back from the ultrabook to the external hard disk took 15 min. 33 sec. I also installed and connected an EPSON L3150 printer to the ultrabook. Printing just work fine.
7. HDMI port: I did connect a LG external screen through the HDMI port, and it did work fine as well.
8. Wireless mouse: I did connect a wireless mouse through one of the USB ports, and it did work very well.
9. Internet connection: I did a test with an internet speed of 24.85 Mbps for download and 6.00 Mbps for upload. I downloaded a 12 Gb folder with documents from Dropbox, and it took 44 min 46 sec. I then uploaded a folder of 60.7 Gb to the transfer file website WeTransfer, and it took 3 min 00 sec. Streaming connection and playing was very fast.
Starting the computer with the digital recognition is perfect.
The ultrabook has one drawback in my opinion: the on/off button on the right side is a bit small and needs to be seen, at least to me.
My overall experience with this ultrabook after 4 days of use is that it is extremely good. Congratulations to LeNovo for building a state-of-art ultrabook, which is very light in weight. They could provide a protecting case for the ultrabook, though, considering its price. It would have been a nice purchase gift. Nevertheless, the computer is worth its price. Hopefully the battery life will remain somewhat constant for over a year. My last laptop (LeNovo Flex 5) lost maybe half of its battery life after one year."," January 1, 2021",5.0

,"I have been using ThinkPads for 17 years and this sorry excuse is a reason to look elsewhere.

Throttling issues - It gets hotter than a firecracker then drops to under 1GHz to cool down. Totally ineffective cooling system.
Cheap plastic - Very hard to take apart, you will snap off the plastic fingers that hold the bottom cover on and it won't go back together easily.
Poor battery life - If you do coax some performance out of this pile, the battery will barely last you two hours - with a 57 watt hour battery.
Limited upgrades - One ""slot"" of RAM is soldered to the board so the most you can add is 32GB. I will max out at 40 GB because of that.
Limited upgrades continued - you can only use an SSD with chips on one side because of the connector. This machine is thin for the sake of thin sacrificing battery and storage upgrades. Good luck getting more than 1TB in it.

P.S. Lenovo knows about the ""throttling"" issue - it's supposedly a bug in the power management driver, don't be fooled. The 28 watt chip guzzles a 50-something watts under heavy load at maximum clock speed and the puny fan and heatsink can't keep up.

What's worse - the heatsking/fan assembly is not bolted to the unibody. When you pull off the bottom cover it's flapping in the breeze.

,"I got the Ryzen 7 8Gig of RAM configuration.
When I got it, it was fast, but the main issue I had was that the Fan noise was jarring. I upgraded the RAM (Added a 16 GB chip) and love how much faster, smoother, and quieter it is.

The display took a little bit of getting used to because it's 16:10 and not 16:9, however I'm happy for the slightly more screen real-estate.

The battery is fast, and I'm happy with the build quality and how easy it is to upgrade.

Things to be mindful of:

The edges are a bit sharp, so if you do a lot of typing, make sure your wrists aren't resting directly on the edge. The fingerprint reader is a little dodgy, but I've set a pin code and am happy with that.

I LOVE the keyboard, the clicks are so satisfying (to me, I know how subjective keyboards are).

All-in-all, it's a great computer for the price. This is more than enough laptop for most people. Gamers: this one isn't for you (unless you're using gamepass or something), and for those who are business power users, this might not be perfect for you either.

The chassis is very sturdy with hardly any flex and the keyboard feels better than other laptops I have tried in a similar/lower price range, and it comes backlit which is a plus.

The touchpad is nice and large but there is still plenty of space for your wrists to rest. The fact that you have a numpad built into the touchpad is pretty cool but I don't foresee myself ever really using it.

Overall fantastic laptop,"This review was made with the laptop I bought and the model is TN3402Q.
This laptop does have a really good keyboard and a large touch pad which can turn into a numpad. I initially believe the monitor on this non-OLED model will be less vivid when compared to my daily used desktop monitor, LG 27GP850. However, with my own observation of using this laptop for watching anime and Youtube, I found no particular bad colour displacement with only a few minor backlight leaks when viewing black background in a dark environment. This laptop also support charging through the type C port with 90W PD.

Although this laptop is pretty good as an all-rounder, with this laptop there are a few things that you will need to know before purchasing.

Firstly this laptop comes with a empty DDR4 slot, and as far as I know the empty slot can only accept DDR4 3200 CL22 8GB SODIMM. EDIT: I have tried installing a 32GB SODIMM and it works on this laptop!!

Secondly there is only one M.2 slot for storage and it is already preoccupied by the system drive that came with this laptop. The only way to get more storage will be a) switch out the 512GB SSD with a larger one and reinstall win11, b) get a external drive or cloud drive for extra storage. I did ended up switching the drive to a 1TB Gold P31. And by the way the official website for this laptop only provides drivers for win11 so no win10 support for this laptop.

Thirdly this laptop came with a crappy wifi card made by MTK! To be honest with you this wifi card is trash and will make this laptop unbearable for someone like me who loves surfing the net all the time. If you really want to buy this laptop you better order another replacement wifi card with it. I personally recommends Intel AX200 or AX210 wifi cards which I also got on my laptop for the optimal user experience.

Thank you for reading this long amateur review. I hope the things listed above can help someone without regretting their purchase of this laptop. It is such a good laptop only if you know what is bad and what you need to do to improve it for the long term."," October 2, 2022",5.0

Goid product,"Great laptop. I did do a 8GB upgrade to 16GB RAM total since it was upgrade-ready and easy to do. Works well and haven't had any issues with it...daily personal use for several weeks. I really like the number pad touch pad since I am almost always using a mouse.

,"Device was in good condition and worked as advertised. The battery is fairly decent and I can go around 8 hours without having to charge it, which is great for work. The speakers are decent too, and I have no problems with any aspect of the device so far."," December 10, 2022",5.0
"First time buying laptop from Asus, it is really good for it's price. But...","The device worked great and looked great, but only for a few days. The build quality felt a little flimsy to me but it started up and ran without issues at first. After a few hours I restarted it and it wouldn't power back on at all, even trying to clear the CMOS and also trying to go into bios recovery mode. It just wouldn't work any longer. It never left my desk and had no physical damage, just stopped working completely.

Requested an exchange from Amazon which was denied and I was forced to return it and get a different laptop, so seems like it may be a more common issue than I thought with this specific device."," December 18, 2022",5.0

ASUS Vivobook S14 delivers great versatility,"Overall, this really is a pretty impressive little machine. It's done everything I've asked it to do, and then some. It mostly gets underused as a web browsing machine for my wife so she can do things online from the comfy couch rather than the basement office, but it keeps her happy which keeps me happy! I've used it for anything from simple time-killer games to 3D designing with SketchUp and it hasn't disappointed me yet. This past weekend I used it to DJ a wedding for a friend, and it ran smoothly with multiple applications going at once. I don't use it in convertible mode very often, but it's super handy to have that option when needed. The auto-rotate screen is very responsive too - just the right amount. It rotates when appropriate but isn't as jumpy as my cell phone that rotates too easily sometimes.

The only thing I don't like about it is the cooling setup. It pretty much completely depends on the air vents on the bottom of it for cooling. But it's a laptop. Its purpose is to be a computer when a desk isn't available, meaning it will literally be sitting on a lap most of the time. It's just too easy to accidentally block of the vents and cause it to overheat, which is very bad for any computer. It's super thin, so I'm sure side venting would have been pretty difficult to engineer, but it's still kind of a necessity. Keep that in mind if you're thinking about getting one. If you can make sure the vents don't get blocked, this is a great little machine. Otherwise, you may want to consider a different style or getting a cooler to sit it on.

I received this as a promotion to review, but I'm not a paid reviewer or employee. This is my honest opinion, and I will update this review if anything changes."," May 16, 2023",5.0
,"It has been really interesting reviewing this laptop. It is the first one I have ever had that is convertible between a laptop and a tablet. Build quality is quite nice and honestly it's about what you would expect for a machine at this price point so no issues there. I think the top of the computer might be aluminum as it feels like it might be but don't quote me for sure on that. I'm just going to talk about some of the major points about this unique machine and some of the things I didn't care for. Spoiler: none of them are what I would call deal breakers.

Performance is quite good with the snappy Ryzen 5 mobile processor. The only problem here is that it only has 8gb of ram! For a new computer in 2022 this just isn't acceptable. That being said upgrading that ram was pretty easy. There are about 8 or so screws on the base then just use a little plastic pry tool to get the back the rest of the way off. It was interesting to note that the 8gb of ram is actually built into the motherboard of this computer. You then get 1 standard laptop DIMM slot. I only had a single 8gb stick with me but I would be interested to see how using a 16gb stick would impact performance. Start to finish the upgrade took less than 10 minutes. I also didn't care for the nvme drive to be only 512gb. Again, for a modern computer in 2022 it should really be 1tb as the cost isn't that large between the 2. Unfortunately there is no where else I saw inside the computer to add a secondary hard drive at all. With the computer now having 16gb I noticed a big increase in speed and performance when working with multiple applications or having several tabs open in Chrome.

I was excited to test out the new Asus Pen 2.0 however this computer didn't come with one! In fact at the time of this review the Asus Pen 2.0 isn't even available in the US. I did go online and purchased one from eBay that is coming in from Hong Kong I believe. I will be sure to update my review once it arrives and I have a chance to test this computer out with it.

Converting this to a tablet was nice and easy with just a flip of the screen. It was nice to see that the hinges seemed nice and strong. The screen is nothing to get excited about but that being said it does have a 16:10 aspect ratio at a resolution of 1920x1200 so just a bit more resolution that standard 1080p HD. Colors and contrast looked good and certainly bright enough for doing detail work indoors. The touch features with just using my fingers worked well.

The keyboard and trackpad setup here is really nice. They keys have a little scoop in them and it felt a bit more comfortable to type on that your average keyboard. The trackpad worked well and the little numpad feature is kinda cool. Just press the little numpad icon on the track pad and then lighting underneath the trackpad illuminates and you have what looks like a projection of a numpad right there on your trackpad. This isn't something I have seen before and if you are someone that loves having a numpad for work stuff, this might be a huge feature for you. There is a thumbprint sensor on one of the keyboard keys and that has been working quite well as well.

All in all I am impressed with this really unique computer. Were it not for the paltry amount of memory and HD space this would have been a 5 star review for me."," September 8, 2022",5.0
A good dual purpose machines (tablet/laptop),"This laptop is one that'd I'd best describe as just enough pep to do what you need it for. That's basically how it is in all categories. It won't be the leader or best in anything, but it's enough to remain competitive. I'll just summarize my comments from the past week of daily usage.

In terms of performance, it's pretty good. The AMD 5600H performs pretty well for most tasks. The system could definitely use a RAM upgrade - it uses basically 50% with nothing open. Just opening Chrome takes it to 70% RAM usage, so watch those tabs. I don't consider the 8GB RAM too much of a limitation though since you can pick up 16GB DDR4 3200Mhz CL 22 sticks fairly cheap and it's an easy swap. I get about 6-7 hours of battery life with screen brightness around 70% and just doing mostly web/document work. Fan is pretty silent during usage like that but will ramp up decently wooshy if any sort of heavy app or game is opened. Battery gets quite warm while charging - my cat loves that.

Storage is fast with the m.2 drive and there's a good amount of space. OS/default apps take up a bit over 40GB of the 475GB available space. I've uninstalled McAfee and the O365 apps but otherwise it's fairly bloatfree for a clean start. I kept the MyASUS app for now, seems like it controls some fan profiles but I haven't played with it too much.

The 1920x1200 screen resolution is quite nice for web/documents since it has a bit of extra vertical space vs a regular 16:9 screen. The screen quality is just OK, nothing amazing. It's definitely not the OLED screen the other Vivobook models have, but it's fine.

Build quality is also decent. It's mostly plastic construction but feels solid and there's no creaking. The blue color is actually more subdued than I thought it'd be, it's darker but quite nice. It does show fingerprints easily unfortunately.

Other random notes:
- Wish it had USB-C charger. It does have one USB 3.2 Type C port that can be used for charging, but just one. The charger that comes with this system is a DC jack type, so it's just something else to buy.
- Speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop. On a table or hard surface it's great. I sometimes use this for streaming videos in tablet mode and they work well get loud if you need them to be.
- Touchpad is responsive and large. I do like the numpad feature, it's more useful than I thought.
- Power button being the fingerprint scanner is a nice feature and works well. It's slightly lower than other keys too so you don't accidentally press it.
- Tablet mode works well and it does disable keyboard when flipped around so that's good. It does not come with a stylus so you'll need your own.
- Keyboard is pretty nice to type on. I usually don't like laptop keyboards either.

So in short, this is a no-frills but reasonable laptop. I'd say it'd make a pretty good daily driver for most tasks. It's not too unique but it does offer some good performance in it's class compared to others."," September 7, 2022",5.0
,"The Asus Vivobook S14 Flip is a versatile laptop/tablet that's great for work on the go or at home, projects, bookkeeping, watching media, and video meetings. The Ryzen 5600H is a great mobile CPU and matches well with the 3200MT/s RAM. Unfortunately this model only comes with 8gb of RAM installed out of the box, which is basically bare minimum for a modern PC. I plan to install another 8gb. These are pretty great specs for a non-gaming notebook is this price range.

Performance: This machine boots in mere seconds and is very snappy when opening apps and doing basic tasks. The combination of the 6 core 12 thread Ryzen CPU with Fast RAM that is right in the sweet spot to get the most out of the processor and the fast NVMe SSD work together very well to eliminate system bottlenecks.

Display: Very nice considering this is not the OLED model. Good color, good brightness, and even pretty decent blacks. Unfortunately it's only 60hz so don't expect to do high end or competitive gaming on this. The touchscreen works great and is very responsive. It can quickly change orientations to portrait mode if you flip the screen to use it as a tablet.

Build quality: Very solid! The keyboard/base of the notebook has good structural rigidity, very little deck flex. The hinge has just the right amount of resistance to keep the screen where you want and keeps everything in place in the tent mode orientation. It feels like it will hold up for a long time.

Bloatware: This is a very clean machine other than having the dreaded McAfee preinstalled. Another reason Asus is superior to manufacturer like Dell and HP who preload all kinds useless apps to run in the background and waste resources.

Audio: It has impressively wide spatial sound. It's a bit lacking in bass, naturally but it's great sound at this price point.

Webcam: Provides a good picture even in fairly low lighting.

Trackpad: Silky smooth as advertised. Supports a range a gestures that are listed in the full manual you can download from the ASUS website. The Numpad functionality is very handy when working with spreadsheets or doing calculations. I should note that my Numpad button was locked by default, so I had to unlock it in the MyASUS app to be able to switch between trackpad and numpad.

BIOS: Most of you will never venture into the BIOS, but for power users/techheads there's not much to find there. The UI looks slick, but there's basically no useful options in there other than changing boot order if you need to boot from a flash drive or the Flash utility that you can use to update the BIOS.

One other thing to add is that the cooling system is very quiet and efficient. Even when running a stress test on the CPU I barely heard a whisper.

Overall. I feel like this device is great at this price point. I foresee using the Vivobook for years."," September 5, 2022",5.0
Just enough pep for the bucks,"I recently received the ASUS Vivobook S 14 Flip and have been extremely impressed with its performance. The laptop is well-equipped with a AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, providing fast and efficient performance for a variety of tasks. The 14"" WUXGA 16:10 touch screen is a nice touch, allowing for easy navigation and a high-quality display. The fingerprint sensor and NumberPad are convenient features, providing added security and making it easy to enter numbers.

One of the things I appreciate most about this laptop is its versatility. The flip design allows me to use it in multiple modes, including laptop, tent, stand, and tablet, making it perfect for a variety of situations. The laptop is also lightweight and portable, making it easy to take with me wherever I go.

The laptop is also well-made and holds up well to regular use. It has held up well over time and has remained in good condition.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the ASUS Vivobook S 14 Flip. It has proven to be a reliable and efficient tool for a variety of tasks, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a high-quality laptop. Five stars!"," December 31, 2022",5.0
,"I picked up this laptop as a replacement for a Chromebook. I was at the point where I wanted to install a few apps and possibly a game, if I can, beyond surfing the web and being limited to Google apps.

The hard drive is ample for what I wanted to install and I also plan to keep a few favorite movies on board. I went ahead and installed MS Office and my favorite game, World of Warships. This was a big test, as WoW requires a lot of memory and GPU. Although, I am not able to use all of the high-end graphics settings or even midlevel in-game, I am able to display a descent level of graphics and play without lag, after all things considered. I was not expecting the game to work as well as it did on 8 GB of RAM, but it passed! At some point I will upgrade the memory, but not a pressing need at the moment. Let me also, point out that it was more of a test to see if WoW would actually play on the laptop. If you are a diehard player, or gamer, the compromise in reduction of graphics display may be a bit too basic.

The ASUS Vivobook with the AMD Ryzen 5 processor produces nice graphics and really good sound for a laptop. The touchscreen display is very responsive to touch, no need to bear down. I like the ability to go from laptop to tablet with an actual Windows 11 OS. It is somewhat like the Microsoft Surface in a lot of ways, except more affordable. The fingerprint reader works well after setup in identifying only my fingerprint and rejecting other family members in my testing of that feature.

Vivobook's battery life is good. I can, in full laptop mode, squeak out five to six hours worth of usage.

Overall, I am very pleased with the Vivobook's performance and quality. It is upgradable in terms of memory and HD and for the price it is quite impressive!"," October 20, 2022",5.0
ASUS quality,"I'll start off with the first step anyone buying this laptop should take (mentioned in other reviews) is upgrade the RAM. Just adding a ~$25 8GB stick of RAM to this will make all the difference in its usability. The system works as delivered but really shines with that small upgrade. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was an available slot to add the stick without having to remove RAM from the system. Previous generations of this laptop required removing the old stick and buying a more expensive stick to upgrade the RAM.

The display has beautiful image quality and touch functionality which is a surprise at this price point.

The NVMe is fast and 512GB which is again amazing at this price point, you are usually looking at a slower drive with 256GB at this price.

The keyboard being backlit is a nice upgrade which many systems still don't include and the ASUS NumberPad in the track pad is a great feature for those that prefer using a number pad. Also, a fingerprint reader is included for quicker logins.

The touchpad is something that needs its own attention. I have a couple of other Asus laptops (both much more expensive) and the touchpads are standard like any other laptop I have used. I find them to be okay to use but much prefer a mouse but this one is very different it really is smoother than any other I have used and just works perfectly. My first reaction was an immediate liking of the smooth feel and loving the responsiveness, I never thought I would find a touchpad that I would consider using in place of a mouse until now."," September 23, 2022",5.0
,"It only seems appropriate that I am writing this review on the laptop. I really love this thing. I purchased myself a very expensive laptop just a few years ago. It is big, and it was supposed to have the 360 hinge, but when it arrived it did not. I almost returned it then but didn't want to go through the hassle. It's a great laptop, but it is big and heavy (comparatively), which is perfect when I have to buckle down and focus on work. But when I need something on the go or just want to do something while chilling, it is too much.
So when I saw this I was super excited. It loads up super fast, actually recognizes my fingerprint (most things won't) and has a good battery life. Touch screen is nice and sensitive. I will mostly be using it for basic internet, streaming movies, and maybe a little gaming. The graphic quality is great as is the sound for the size. And the 360 is a MUST if you have cats (hello being able to stream a movie without the cats walking over the keyboard and turning it off!!).
I haven't tried any video editing on it yet, but I will be soon and am hopeful it will be up to the task. I think the only thing I'd really like would be one more USB port, but I'll just have to dig out my hub when I get to that point.
Bonus, it came with a bunch of stickers you can decorate it with. Not my thing personally, but a super cute idea."," September 7, 2022",5.0
great for home use,This is a nice laptop with alot of power as well as lightweight. The 14 inch touch screen is nice and responsive. Love your able to flip it into a tablet. The apps are easy to use and set up. The keyboard is smooth and easy to use. I like the security with the fingerprint option in addition to the standard security. The colors on the screen are super rich. I definitely recommend this window laptop.," September 11, 2022",5.0
,"Update/Edit: I upgraded the ram to test if gaming performance improves. More found in the gaming part of my review. I also added section notation and titles.

-Starting Notes:

This is a great lap/tablet top. It is an interesting category as it is both a tablet and a laptop, with emphasis to laptop in design. There is some real attention to detail here as well, like pushing the power button behind the DEL button to prevent accidental shut downs, that still occurred in my testing mind you, which really does help. I am actually more excited now than before I got it.

One thing I wish they included was the stylus that the screen supports and that is one caveat.

-Display Quality:

Speaking of screens, for this price range I found zero options that look as good as this screen. Moreover, the next best ones I found were screens associated with Dell XPS and Apple laptops. This is an incredibly adept screen with amazingly vivid colors. It does not come with a high refresh rate panel, stuck at 60hz, but I doubt that will be an issue as the Vivo Flip does not do great on synthetic game tests, more on the tests later though. This is a 8 bit color screen and that isn't bad with how awesome it looks. You may be able to get more colors with a 10 bit, but even my XP Pen 22 artist 2nd gen is a 8 bit screen. Colors look better on the vivo, but I feel like there is a bit of an issue with accuracy. The accuracy isn't bad, but I can see that. Overall, do not fault the color here as it is very good. I also have a Dell Inspiron around this price range, as well as two Acer laptops, and all of those screens look like garbage in comparison. (All three of them are good laptops in many ways though, but screen quality is noticeably worse.)

-Number Pad:

Something I love, and is a different display type I suppose, is that this comes with a number pad. It is a non-traditional number pad, but it is included! I rejoice to find a formfactor of this caliber and it also includes a number pad. You will find the number pad on the touchpad, an icon that looks like a calculator/number pad design is found in the upper right corner. You press and hold that until the trackpad lights up to reveal the numbers. You can adjust the trackpad's light by pressing and holding the triangle with circles in the corners which are on the upper left side. There are only two brightnesses for the number pad. I am very happy with this design.

-USB-C Charge Notes:

Another thing I am happy for, but wish for an improvement, is that you can charge this via USB-C. I am running it on the same dock as my Dell XPS, and even my Acer Swift-X works on it. The thing is, I feel like they could improve this as they have a built in proprietary plug that comes with this. It is a lost opportunity here in that another USB port of some kind could have been installed in that spot. My Swift X from Acer suffers from this as well but the Intel version of the Swift X fixes that issue

-Build Quality:

Build quality is great overall. The main body is mostly plastic from what I can see, but when close, the thick aluminum shell of the screen does a great job offering rigidity. That rigidity helps during transportation as well as when the computer is being used in tablet form factor. That rigidity is really good. Overall, I am also impressed with the weight, obviously heavier than a tablet, where this is lighter than a normal laptop, even though it feels better than my Dell XPS.

-Sound Quality:

Sound quality here is actually amazing for the class, but there is a caveat. This system is designed to reflect sound off of a surface. It especially sounds good on my butcher block top desk. The issue is, I have it installed on a arm when at my desk, for multitasking work and fun. On the stand, it had nothing to bounce off of and it didn't offer a great first impression. Once on the table, it was night and day difference though and I recommend wood. I tested other surfaces as well. Including my lap, carpet, (which are bad ideas for heat) as well as my really standard kitchen countertop and plastic of my family's picnic table in the back. Wood sounded best, and the thicker/sturdier it was the better it sounded. I feel like it really does a great job competing with the sound my my Dell XPS 9300 which I found most laptops fail against. (Apple being the exception for sound quality comparison where it is close but Apple's seems to focus on a weird sound curve so I like my Dell better than what I tested from Apple.)

-Gaming:

I don't think you will be gaming on this. You can do some games like web games and not very intensive 2D games for example. This is where the Swift X has the Asus Vivo Flip beat, well one of the things. When I tested this with Time Spy, it was a dismal 749 score. I would say this is not a good computer to play games on because of this. Part of the issue is likely due to a lack of ram, where I will touch up on that subject soon. However, because of the performance this is more for productivity and movies/music. I can also see this used in art, but I would recommend an upgrade of the ram.

-Edit/Addition: Gaming reference:

I can say a 8GB ram upgrade does improve from the original 749 3DMark Time Spy synthetic test, it is still not exactly what I would call a gaming computer, just improving performance enough to get by in some games at low setting, with an improved score of 1294 which is 43% improvement. The extra ram did improve the CPU score as well, from 4127 to 5825 which I originally neglected to point out was close to the desktop Ryzen 5 3600x.

-Ram Upgrade:

Speaking of ram, it is upgradable... sort of. Opening this shell up requires finesse. There are 10 screws in the bottom, which I used a #0 Phillips bit. When you get all the screws out, you need to use a guitar pick to shimmy open the bottom of the case. There are loads of clips that I am afraid could break and starting from the back of the computer, where the computer vents heat, you work along the edge to pop out the clips. (Pressing inward and up while the pick is in there will release the back easily, but you have to experiment around the sides and front.) When you get the bottom casing off, you will not notice an easily accessible location for ram, but there is a large metal box. Under the box, which you can pop up with the pick used earlier, you will find the sodimm slot for ram. When you replace the ram, you can put the box back over the top, it is grounded for EMI (electromagnetic interference) related reasons I feel. However, you need to be careful to install it correctly and that all parts of the box should be on the inside of the tiny metal pegs which hold it in place as well and encircle the sodimm ram slot. (I think en-rectangle should be a word as it describes the shape better.) The bottom casing we took off earlier can be reinstalled and will also keep the box from popping off or coming loose. Remember that the center screw is the only screw that is larger in length than the rest.

-Additional note/Edit:

When upgrading ram, you will want Sodimm (laptop) memory, at DDR4 3200Mhz with CL 22 (cas latency.) If you match it up properly, you will see fewer issues with compatibility as well as the original 3200mhz speed for ram inside this. You can install any ""Sodimm DDR4 3200 CL22"" memory size from 4GB to I suspect 32GB. Having more ram allows for more programs, more tabs, or more elaborate art.

-Final Thoughts:

I actually love this computer, and I noticed that I switched from calling it laptop. It offers more functionality than your typical laptop, is really good with productivity, more portable, great sound, amazing display, includes a number pad in the trackpad, and I can only fault it for having hard to get to ram access, gaming score, and not including the stylus. I would say this is a 5 star, and really is worth the money. I would suggest upgrading the ram, but it works well for everyday use without that upgrade. However, standard use and I saw it use up 73% of the included ram, so make sure you close your tabs in Chrome if you don't want to upgrade the memory.

Pros:

-Amazing screen quality
-Amazing sound quality while on a hard surface.
-Amazing productivity flexibility.
-Number pad at 14 inch laptop form factor!

Cons:
-Harder than average ram upgrade. (But it can be upgraded!)
-No included Stylus.
-Limited Ram at 8GB"," September 3, 2022",5.0

,"I needed a laptop for work/school. Mainly one that was portable and could run tougher programs. I bought this in place of my gaming laptop so that I could take it places without a charging block attached. This laptop performs just as well as my $800 gaming laptop, and is portable! I love being able to turn this into a tablet and watch videos or play music off of it. The speakers are pretty good, but once you go over 50/100 on it you start to hear some distortion. Crisp sound until then though. I wish it came with a pen, but I'll have to do my research to find my own. The light up num pad is also very nice to have. I found it's a little hard to use since you can't feel around where your hand is, but it's still a very cool feature! I went on YouTube and pulled up a video in 4k (2160p) and it looks flawless! The USB C port is also a nifty add on, but it won't charge nearly as fast as it would with the charger that came with it. I haven't tested the battery life too much, but I know the charging is incredibly fast when using the charger that came with it. Overall, well worth the money. Incredibly quick and has room for additional RAM. 9/10 only because the speaker distortion and the need for a pen."," October 29, 2022",5.0
Awesome portable laptop,"Muy bonita laptop, la pantalla se ve muy bien y se siente bien La batería dura bien, nada extraordinario pero buen batería y carga rápido. Además, la propia computadora a través de MyAsus cuenta con un modo de protección de pila que limita su carga al 80% de su capacidad para proteger a la misma y que dure más, de todas formas recuerda no dejarla conectada por mucho tiempo. Es relativamente ligera, fácil de transportar y se siente premium, el cuerpo es mayoritariamente de plástico pero parece ser que la pantalla cuenta con cuerpo de aluminio, lo que le da buena apariencia. El rendimiento es bueno, me permite buenas multitareas sin bugeo. Aún no la pruebo para juegos pero actualizaré cuando tenga tiempo de probarlos. En cuanto al modo tableta y el touch, los gestos funcionan bien, pero a veces el touch puede fallar un poco, cómo que no se reconoce o se reconoce de manera espontána sin toque, sin embargo me he dado cuenta que esto solo pasa en Youtube pantalla completa. Además, hay sitios web y algunas aplicaciones que no están bien optimizadas para el touch. Ej. la página de la NFL no admite entrada táctil, o Adobe que si aceptada entrada táctil pero se siente mal optimizada y poco fluida. En cuanto a los programas de Office el touch funciona completamente normal, igual en sitios como YouTube (salvó por el comentario anterior), Crunchyroll, Netflix, Star, Dinsey+, pero a veces se puede sentir un poco la falta de optimización. Cuenta con teclado retroiluminado y el panel táctil del mouse tiene un botón para activar un teclado numérico bastante útil. El desbloqueo con huella no es la gran cosa, traté de configurar mi huella pero el lector no funciona de manera muy adecuada, la desbloqueo de manera convencional, es más rápido. El nivel de brillo no es la gran cosa pero se ve muy bien en interiores, no así, los reflejos aumentan con la iluminación ambiental y claro en exteriores. De igual manera la pantalla se ve muy bien y ya me la han chuleado. Aún no he modificado nada, pero parece ser que cuenta con una ranura extra para memoria RAM. La cámara cuenta con bloqueo físico. Viene con teclado extranjero, no cuenta con Ñ pero se puede configurar el teclado a LATAM, solo que las teclas no van a corresponder con los carácteres especiales (no letras), aunque puede ser tantito molesto solo es acostumbrarse. El cuerpo se ve un poco más grueso de lo que esperaba, pero igual es delgada y se ve elegante. Las bisagras se sienten firmes y resistentes y permiten varios ángulos.

Lo malo, las bocinas no están tan buenas a pesar de ser Hardman Kardon, al principio se escuchaban bien y no les daba un uso excesivo, pero cuando las usaba si lo hacía con el volumen algo alto, así que cuidado con eso porque dos semanas bastó para que las bocinas ""reventaran"" y ahora si se escuchan pero con algo de estática. EDIT Parece ser que el problema de las bocinas tenía que ver con la BIOS, para que el sistema funcione bien la BIOS debe estar debidamente actualizada. Así lo hice y tras la actualización las bocinas volvieron a funcionar de manera normal, si se escuchan muy bien pero nada extraordinario. Sin embargo, apartir de esta experiencia me he enterado que la laptop no cuenta con forma de hacer válida la garantía ya que es producto de E.U.A y las políticas de la Asus en México con cubren garantías de productos que no hayan sido exportados por Asus México. Así que mi laptop funciona normal y es excelente para uso diario multimedia y productividad, pero no tiene respaldo de garantía. Si hubiera algún otro mal aspecto sobre estás laptop, mencionaria el hecho de tener que limpiar la pantalla con frecuencia pues me encanta usar el touch.

En general una excelente compra, no me arrepiento pero probablemente adquirir un seguro para la misma no sería mala idea en caso de accidentes."," November 16, 2022",5.0
,"I bought this laptop so I could work at places other than my office. My more device-savvy kid picked the laptop and the specs, so if you’re looking for a technical review, this isn’t it. I’m running Office in whatever version they’re calling it these days. 365? My bread & butter is running QuickBooks Desktop (QBDT) and that program can be a bit of a resource hog. My new ThinPad has handled it beautifully. I liked that I could add the Lenovo app and customize my settings even more than what windows offers. This laptop is super light and thin - she’s practically a supermodel. I love that I can toggle a slide and a red dot shows me the camera is closed. The slide is a little hard to see because it’s black in black so I took a metallic silver sharpie and marked it. Problem solved. I like the feel of the 10-key, but I have smaller hands. Someone with larger hands might not find it roomy enough. The matte surface is pretty, but it definitely shows fingerprints. I was cleaning the cover pretty much daily. That got old quick so I got a cute skin. Always a work around. Keep in mind, I’m not an expert, I’m an end user and I think this laptop will do nicely. When the box arrived the charger was missing. I immediately emailed the seller and they sent one right out. Mistakes happen, but they were very responsive."," August 18, 2020",5.0

Outside of an obscenely long repair job from the manufacturer, the seller who purchased it (Issaquah Highlands Tech) from Lenovo is washing their hands because it lasted more than a month (lol) which is the minimum that amazon requires (lol). So I would avoid using this seller, and I would advise considering buying directly from the manufacturer purchases like these. This is my second Lenovo, the first being a Yoga 910 that lasted many years. The eyboard on this one lasted 4 months, and that's specifically why I got it. Pretty frustrating to say the least.

,"Lenovo Warranty

I purchased a Legion 5i (17”) with GTX 1660 Ti 81Y80005 US for $1,209.46, so it wasn’t a cheap laptop by any means. Within 6 months the blue screen of death occurred the laptop would not start up. When I bought the laptop Lenovo’s PREMIER service support came with the machine. I contacted Lenovo’s PREMIER service support.
The PREMIER service support agent told me I needed to pack up the laptop and send it to them for repairs. I asked for my money back since this happened so early in the life span of the laptop, I was denied. I asked for a new laptop, again I was denied. I was told there was nothing their PREMIER service could do and to send the laptop back to Lenovo. Anything but PREMIER service.
I am a disabled Vet on a fixed income with my spouse who is also disabled. We use the laptop daily for medical appointments, ordering medicine, bills, ect. We lost all that information.
I contacted Lenovo PREMIER service once again. This time I got someone on the phone who decided to help me make a restore usb image. I did this on a dell backup laptop that is 10 years old and still works, that laptop replaced a dell laptop that was out of warranty but dell replaced it. It took two days to get this laptop running. But a least I got someone who was willing to help. I guess willing is PREMIER service.
I spent over 1,200 on a machine that crashed within 6mo. I again requested my money back or a new machine, both denied. I was denied help, until I persisted. I then asked PREMIER service for a warranty extension since I have lost confidence this laptop will last. I was sent an email asking why I needed an extension on my warranty, I explained basically what I have explained here. I was offered a 30-day Warranty extension. 30 days is a slap in the face Lenovo PRIEMIER service.
I have bought office chairs, hue lights, tablet all from Lenovo. This is the first time I have has to use Lenovo’s warranty service. I will not purchase anything else from Lenovo because all is fine until you need support. Or in my case lack of it. Do not buy products from Lenovo. There isn’t any support if it goes bad. PREMIER service or lack of any service. Thank you Lenovo PREMIER service for the 30 day warranty extension After all my purchase’s and my $1,200 purchase that crashed within 6mo. STAY AWAY, STAY CLEAR of purchasing anything from LENOVO.
Update: Lenovo contacted me after my postings. They are now offering me 90 day warranty. STAY AWAY, STAY CLEAR of purchasing anything from LENOVO.
Update: I posted a review on Lenovo’s website; this was their response.

,"I purchased one of these Chromebooks in January, 2023. At the time, it was on sale for $150. At that price, I just wanted to see what it could do.

TLDR SUMMARY
For the price of a couple of dinners out, this thing is a steal. It's completely silent, comfortable to type on, and because it is powered by an ARM processor, the battery life is excellent. I'm getting 10 hours or more of general use.

SCREEN QUALITY
The Chromebook S330 has a HD (1366x768) 14"" screen. It's decent but not great. For the price, I think it is more than adequate.

AUDIO QUALITY
The audio is minimal. It's fine for listening to podcasts but for a good music or movie experience, I'd recommend a good set of Bluetooth headphones.

BUILD QUALITY AND TYPING
This Chromebook feels cheap but not flimsy. The monitor holds firm during normal use. No shaking that I can see. The keyboard is comfortable to type on and pretty quiet. Again, for the price, its hard to complain.

EMAIL AND OFFICE APPS
Chromebooks rely on web apps, so you can't install Microsoft Office. You can, however, use Office Online, which is very good and gets better every year. It's also free to use. GSuite apps include Google Docs and Google Sheets, which I also like. Those also work offline. Ironically, Google Docs is an app that seems challenging for cheap Chromebooks. The S330 still runs it, but it takes around ten seconds to load fully. This is annoying but not a deal breaker for me.

STREAMING
I've tested Netflix, Disney+, and Spotify on this Chromebook. They all work as expected but, again, I'd recommend a set of headphones. The picture isn't especially vibrant but its good for the price.

GAMES
Chromebooks can run web games and some Android games from the Google Play store. I played a few retro arcade games and the Android versions of Baldur's Gate and The Banner Saga. They all worked well. I did not try any of the game streaming services because I don't have a subscription to any of them.

LINUX APPS
Most Chromebook users probably don't mess with this feature, but I enabled Linux and installed VS Code. It worked surprisingly well. This laptop would be perfectly adequate for basic web development or learning to code. I didn't try Android Studio but I suspect it wouldn't run very well. The Android emulators can be resource-intensive, and this device just doesn't have a lot of muscle. I'll give it a try eventually and update this review if I find anything surprising.

I hope this review was helpful! It's amazing what you can get for $150 these days.

It's a good device for browsing the web and runs Chrome well. Office productivity depends on either the GSuite apps (Google Docs, Sheets, etc), which can work offline or else Office Online. Both work well, but they take a few seconds to load before they become responsive enough to type on. Ironically, I find that Google Docs is one of the apps that challenge cheap Chromebooks the most. Email and the like all work well.

Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, etc, all work well. Again, I recommend headphones.

I tried connecting to my office Slack channel, and it worked, but I wouldn't describe it as performant.

Chromebooks connect well with Android Phones, and this functionality seemed solid with my (also cheap) Moto G5. No complaints."," February 9, 2023",4.0
A steal at $150,"This is my first Chromebook and I love it. The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find. This Chromebook is none of that, the ease of this is like using a smartphone. I have absolutely no problem with the screen resolution , it looks fine to me. I can't comment on the battery life because I've yet to unplug it, I use it strictly as a stay in one place computer (plugged in all the time). Google Docs and files take a little getting used to if you never used them, but once you get used to it you'll have no problem. It was not a problem for me because I was already use them on my iPhone . You can't download outside programs because its a closed system, to me , that's a good thing because I only use it to surf the web, shop, emails and files. And because you can't download programs your not gonna pick up any viruses. If you need to edit any photos you can always download a photo app from the Play store. I've found the storage and speed for this to be just fine, it doesn't seem to slow down with numerous tabs open. You have a load of apps to download from the Google play store that should keep you happy. I don't use it to stream movies or play games so I can't comment on that, I'll streams stuff from YouTube with no problems at all. If you want a laptop to do just the basics like I do, then you can't go wrong with this for the price. To me it's way better then one of those low cost Windows PC's. I had a low end Windows PC that I bought as a extra computer for me to use when my wife is working on the expensive PC, I hated it so much I gave it away before it was a month old. Besides being intrusive and confusing, it was slow as crap. This Chromebook is like having a giant smartphone with a keyboard, (IT'S THAT EASY). The only reason I took away one star is because I think it could of used one more USB port, other then that I love it, and if you use a computer like I do, you will too.
PS. Keep in mind that this model S330 comes in different specs. My review is based on the model with the higher resolution screen (1920 x 1080) and more memory (64gb). They have a cheaper model called the S330 with less resolution and less memory."," January 18, 2019",4.0
,"I don't understand all the negative reviews about the screen. It's not the BEST laptop screen I've ever used, but FAR from the worst. And for less than $250? Are you guys kidding me? Are you expecting an ipad pro level screen?

The laptop is solid even though it's plastic, I'm not worried about putting this thing in my backpack. While the keyboard is a little stiff for my taste, it works well. I'm just used to my mechanical keyboard on my desktop. I can write and do some coding perfectly fine and that's how I would describe this chromebook:

Perfectly fine.
Solid.
Reliable.
Lenovo-quality.
I might as well be in one of their commercials, but Lenovo has never failed me.

The negatives?

The screen can be a BIT wobbly when I adjust it, but that's minor. It doesn't wobble when I type, which would make me want to return it. A couple more ports would be nice as well as an SD card slot that allows the SD card to completely insert. This one, the card sticks out halfway.

Battery life is great, can go for hours at the library without needing to be plugged in and I'm using a higher brightness. I'm not doing anything intensive, just chrome tabs, spotify, watching Youtube.

If you need a laptop to take care of your internet needs and basic computer needs, this is a solid one for the price. If you need stronger hardware, then spend at least 400-500. However, if you're already spending that much money, it might be better to get a Windows machine, unless you LOVE Chromebooks.

I love Chrome OS for what it is. Fast, lightweight, and cost-effective. That's the name of the game. If you buy this laptop, or any laptop a this price, then don't expect a thousand-dollar plus experience and then leave horrible reviews. This is a solid chromebook, especially for the price. I'll be keeping this one for a long while and give it to a family member when it's time for me to upgrade."," January 22, 2020",4.0

,"I used a Chromebook C330 for a few years, which I absolutely loved. I bought the S330 thinking it would basically be the same, just with a larger display and higher resolution. And much of it is the same. Like the C330, the S330 keyboard is excellent. The trackpad is good. It has the same MediaTek processor which, though by no means fast, is fine for general productivity use, and it gets amazing battery life.

Unfortunately, this otherwise great laptop is ruined by the worst display I have ever seen on a laptop. Unlike the C330, which has a nice, crisp, sharp display, the display on the S330 is so bad it is basically unusable.

To start with, colors are so washed out that some parts of the screen blend into each other. The top of the shelf, for example, is a blurry line instead of a crisp edge. The color reproduction is awful. All shades of gray have a light blue tint to them. At a normal viewing angle, a gray button on a white background at the bottom of the screen is basically invisible.

To get an idea of what this display looks like, imagine taking a screenshot of your desktop, loading it into Photoshop, adding a layer, flooding it with blue, and then reducing the opacity to make it semi-transparent. That’s what it’s like using this display. It’s like the entire screen has a filmy blue filter placed over the top of it that gives everything a slightly blue tint, and also makes the entire screen appear fuzzy. The effect is so pronounced that I’m pretty convinced the display on this particular one might be defective. I simply can’t believe anyone at Lenovo could have looked at this display and thought it was acceptable for any use. Then again, a lot of other reviewers have complained about the display too.

The display, at least on this one, is so bad that I literally can’t use it for more than a few minutes before I start getting a headache from eye strain.

I’m not sure what Lenovo was thinking when they took an otherwise great laptop and completely ruined it by putting such an awful display on it.

Overall, I can’t recommend this laptop to anybody. Even if all you do is basic productivity, you will find yourself getting a headache from eye strain in just a few minutes. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because everything else about it is great. But the horrible display really does make this otherwise great laptop unusable."," July 9, 2021",4.0
Boots up Readily,"Bought this for my highschooler it already cracked one Chromebook. Never realized how much he wanted a touchscreen until he didn’t have one!

,"This is very much a case where if you are realistic in your expectations, you will be quite happy with the product. Chromebooks serve a rather specific purpose, and are built at a pretty low price point. They are basically just really low end laptops, so low in spec that they only run well on a web-browser-based operating system. Most have low resolution screens of varying quality. If you need something with full HD 1920x1080 resolution, this Lenovo is one of the very few options. And for the price, this is a great laptop. Yes, the display has a pretty narrow viewing angle. But you shouldn't expect a Retina or MS Surface quality display at this price point. It gets the job done, it is bright and clear (at the right angle) and it has better resolution than anything else at this price. The wifi is a little weak, but again, it does the job.
Everything else about it is quite solid. Battery life is superb. The keys have just the right amount of travel and resistance to make typing very comfortable. The touchpad works as it should. It has just enough weight to feel like a real laptop, but without feeling heavy.

So again, be realistic in your expectations. Next to a $1300 Surface, this Lenovo comes up way short. But against anything else in the sub $350 market, it is a great buy. At the current Amazon Warehouse price of $200, it is a steal.

I bought the refurb/warehouse version. It came in the original box with all of the packaging. I couldn't even tell it had ever been opened. Not a scratch, dent, or mark on it."," June 7, 2019",4.0
Happy thus far not giving money to Bill Gates,"I purchased this Chromebook for the main purpose of watching movies and TV shows. Unfortunately, the TN panel screen does not display movies well at all. The image is washed out, colors are off, and during dark scenes you can barely tell what's going on in the movie due to the severe backlight bleeding. But, I will say, in all other respects I was very pleased with the machine. It's very quick and responsive, battery life is great, and if you're using it to surf the web, read/write emails, play simple games or other typical daily tasks it works great!

Some things I wish I would have known: Skype for Business does not really work on a Chromebook, so if you were getting this to work from home during quarantine and your office uses Skype for Business a lot, this is not going to work for you. There are no function keys (F1-F10) on top of the keyboard, nor is there a delete key, which I find annoying. The very far right and far left edge of the touch pad do not seem to be functional. It does not really impact functionality much, just something I have noticed. Battery life is good, but not quite as good as advertised. The other thing that I find most annoying is that the plastic casing really shows fingerprints and oil from your hands. But, again, for the money, I am happy with it."," April 14, 2020",5.0
"Nice for the money, but takes some getting used to.","If you need a basic Chromebook for student use, this is an ok, but not great version. It has a bit more memory than the lower end Chromebooks, but since Chromebooks are typically used to work with cloud-based applications, you really don't need the additional RAM for the most part, and you can save money buying a lower-end Chromebook instead. There is one big shortcoming with this Chromebook - unlike nearly every other Chromebook manufactured and sold since 2019, this one does not support Android Apps. That might not be a big deal for some users. The lack of support for Android Apps means that there are bunch of games and applications that are specifically designed to work with Android devices and Chromebooks, none of which will work on this one. I did some research, and this specific make/model is listed on Google's continuously updated list of Chromebooks that are supposed to work with Android Apps, but when you try to access any Android Apps, you'll find that you can't even access the Android App store for Chromebooks. Google also has another website with instructions for how to download Android Apps, and that site also explains how to identify whether your Chromebook is physically capable or not.

Would I recommend this Chromebook? No. It's more expensive than many other Chromebook options, and since this specific model does not support Android Apps, it is more expensive, less capable version than literally dozens of other Chromebook options. I ended up returning the one I bought. Lenovo is a solid brand for inexpensive Chromebooks and laptops, so there are plenty of other options whether you want a less expensive, basic Chromebook for school, or other Windows laptop options if you want to also be able to install some of the most popular online games."," January 10, 2021",5.0

Their solution was to return BOTH the Chromebook and AC Adaptor, which seemed unnecessary. Rather than it be a like replacement, it was a money refund. The refund amount offered was $30 less than what I paid for it. So I didn't take them up on their return offer.

,"This is a good value for a budget machine. Its austere plastic body probably wouldn't survive much abuse but it does have a mat texture that wards off finger prints. It's nice to have the 14"" 1920 x 1080 mat screen and thin bezel. On a full charge I can go eight hours editing text while streaming music from wi-fi to bluetooth headphones and leave a good third of the battery remaining. It comes with Google Drive of course but I easily synced Dropbox as well using a free third party app. What I like most is that now you can install Linux apps. No need for Crouton. You just open a terminal in Chrome OS and type something like ""sudo apt install libreoffice"" say, and you end up with a new shortcut that you can pin to the ""shelf"" (taskbar) and from there said app can be launched, all while never leaving the Chrome OS desktop. You can keep a separate storage space for your Linux data or ""share"" your Google Drive data with Linux. So you can for example use Linux's Libre Office Write to open and save a file directly from/to the cloud, preserving the Chrome OS thin-client motif."," November 20, 2019",5.0
Beware of AC Adaptor,"I've wanted a Chromebook for years, but could never really justify the purchase...until recently. I've been taking some trips out of town, and needed to be available for work, just in case, but I didn't want to risk taking my work laptop with me on the trips. So, I bought this Chromebook. I use Chrome Remote Desktop to control my work laptop, which is sitting at home, and it's been a great experience. With a good WIFI connection, It feels just like I'm working on the remoted machine. The keyboard feels good, and I'm able to type just fine. I thought I'd be missing having function keys, but there's a system setting to treat the top row of icon keys as if they were F1 - F10, and it works great. If I want to use whatever the icon for that key is supposed to do, I just press the search key (just above the shift key) to use those keys. Apart from needing this for work, most of what I use the computer for is web-related stuff; looking things up, email, watching videos, etc. This works great for that. I'm amazed that a machine for just over $200 can do everything I need to do. The screen is a little washed out, color-wise, but after a couple of days, I don't even notice that any more. The battery life is amazing. I've been working on it now for a couple of hours, and it says I've still got 9 hours of battery left."," May 6, 2019",5.0
,"I purchased this Chromebook after my 4 year old Toshiba Chromebook 2 finally started having issues. I paid almost the same price back in 2015 for the Toshiba that I did for the Lenovo. I was hoping to find a similar quality machine and boy was I wrong. Here are the main issues with the Lenovo.

Screen Quality - I have no idea what Lenovo was thinking with this screen. You have to have the perfect angle to see anything, and even once you find that angle, it still looks like garbage. The colors are always washed out, black text on a white background looks almost grey. This is embarrassing for a lcd screen made in the past 10 years.

Speakers - I listen to a lot of videos and music on my chromebook. My old Toshiba had amazing sound for a chromebook, and I was not expecting to find the same quality without paying for it. But the “speakers” that the Lenovo have are hilarious. I can’t believe how bad they are. Not only are they very flat and hollow sounding, you can barely hear them at max volume. I even tried using the “Audio EQ” extension, that allows you to boost the preamp and increase volume. Even with that it truly sounds like you have headphones plugged in, sitting on the desk with the volume max. Terrible!

Wifi - I have plenty of devices in my home running on a 5Ghz connection with 100+ mb/s internet. Everything works fine...But the Lenovo. Sitting 5’ away from the router shows a “medium” connection strength. This translated when trying to watch videos and every new video had to “load” for a second, before dropping the quality down for a minute or two while the computer tried catch up.

The battery seemed to hold up after a day of ""Using it"". Mainly trying to find if some setting was causing all of the issues and poor quality.

The keyboard felt fine. Trackpad was fine.

I ended up returning this and buying the Acer Chromebook 14. These two should not be within $300 of each other. If the Lenovo was a $150 chromebook, I could argue that for the price, at least it kind of works. But when they are asking the same price as some of the other brands that are much higher quality, I had to leave a review to warn others. I use a $2500+ Lenovo workstation laptop everyday as an engineer and I have nothing bad to say about it. But this Chromebook is garbage. Don’t buy it. Find other options."," May 27, 2019",5.0

Good value. Comes with Linux integrated.,"My middle-schoolers do a lot of work at school on Chromebooks through Google Classroom. I wanted to give them a similar experience at home while keeping the cost reasonable and support overhead very low. The Lenovo Chromebook S330 was just the trick. This thing is fast, the screen is clear and bright and the battery life is awesome with an estimated life of 13 hours. Is it really 13 hours? Who knows, but it last through 6 hours of constant and showed a little over half battery remaining, so it seems reasonable.

For perspective, ""best"" in terms of computer hardware and operating system really comes down to your intended use. You'll get the best value and have the best experience when you buy for that intended use. For what I've described above, this Chromebook is perfect. I could have spent a lot more on a high-performance gaming rig or something with a touchscreen and all the extras, but that's not what was needed.

Some suggestions for improvement: better screen resolution and contrast adjustment. And the power cord should be pin rather than a mini - plug .

Even at 1080P it looks fuzzy, some of this is due to ChromeOS' poor display scaling for the User Interface, which is irrelevant to this laptop as that is something that would show up on all Chromebooks. I didn't notice any bad delay when trying to open programs or anything, but the use of eMMC storage really slows this laptop down, with it not being nearly as responsive as an SSD, but thats something you get when trying to purchase a laptop at this pricepoint, some corners need to be cut. The real killer is the trackpad, not being particularly smooth in movement and the clicks were not always registered. If you are looking for a cheap solution to get you through just typing some Docs or watching Youtube videos this Chromebook may work for you but I would spend closer to 300 to have some of the issues dealt with better.

,"Lenovo Chromebook 330S: Excellent value for the money, wanted to replace a capable but heavy Lenovo Thinkpad that I was carrying from school to home.

For creating and editing documents, compatibility issues abounded with the loathsome Word for ios and Google Docs can't come close to the flexibility of creating documents in standard-version Word. I worried that there is little-to-no storage on Chromebooks, but adding a micro SSD card allows for onboard, sleekly integrated storage, which can supplement cloud storage or an external drive if desired. Solid feel to keyboard, bright crisp picture, very fast internet and processing speed.

Google really likes to talk about how secure its Chromebooks are, and that’s because they are secure. Chrome OS executes every application in its own sandbox, which keeps programs from making any changes to the rest of your system. Chrome OS is also unable to run .exe files, so most malware can’t be installed on Chromebooks. Because of these security protections, it’s almost impossible to get viruses onto your Chromebook."," March 20, 2021",4.0

Pros:
- Great performance
- Solid build quality. Not gaudy and flashy like a lot of gaming laptops out there
- Monitor quality

Cons:
- Need to buy extra memory and storage which makes it hard to justify the current pricepoint
- Preinstalled with windows 11 which has stability issues with this laptop. I'd recommend uninstalling and getting windows 10 as soon as you get this thing
- Poor battery life. Lasts 4 hours tops with normal usage

With the exception of the battery, the cons honestly aren't really cons as much as they're hindrances hence the headline, but you do need to be a bit tech-savvy and get the extra hardware to make this thing really shine."," June 28, 2023",4.0
,"Tldr: it's a good laptop that has 1 open nvme slot if you want to expand your storage and it has 1 open Ram slot for expanding your ram. It's worth investing the 20 or so dollars to get another 8 gig 3200 speed ram sitck, if you want.

it came with 8 gigs of single rank 3200 speed Ram, a 3rd gen 512 GB Samsung nvme I think it was 3200 mb/s read and I want to say 2200mb/s write and one nvme slot unpopulated, Realtek ethernet/Wi-Fi 6 capable wireless card, no SSD cradle (just in case you are looking at YouTube videos and saw that one was installed in there) its fine and a 3060 Max P if I remember correctly.

Here's where things got a little frustrating.

I had to plug it in before the power button would power on the computer despite it having 40% battery (this only happened once), it took a lot longer to boot the first time; long enough I thought it was broken and then the screen turned on. Windows 11 came installed and was about a year out of date (last november 2021), which is understandable stuff sits in a warehouse but it's kind of buggy till you run Windows update, so do that first thing then install your programs or some won't open when you try to run them (happened to me)

Now the ram situation. Amd processors work much better with dual channel ram which means two sticks of ram not one 8 gig stick. Its unacceptable at this price point (my opnion), that said it was doable on 8 gigs; when you take into account switchable graphics mode takes 2 gigs of ram the cpus on chip graphics this leaves you with 6 gigs for system tasks, but once you start getting stuff installed Windows uses about 4 gigs of RAM leaving you 2 gigs free. I just don't know how 8 gigs of RAM is sufficient these days given what I mentioned, that said it did surprisingly well in cyberpunk on mostly high settings at 1080p.

Secure boot was enabled by default which is kinda annoying because if you wanna run Linux you have to disable that if I remember correctly and amd's platform security processor was also enabled by default as well. most people won't care about this or even know what they are but it's an annoyance for people who want to install other operating systems ( just hit F2 while the computer is booting if you want secure boot disabled)

I didn't feel right not mentioning these things, it's something I wouldve wanted to know before purchasing if I didn't know much about computers. Overall I'm happy it just took a second to get it setup and running optimally."," October 5, 2022",4.0

,"The ""Used - Good Condition"" purchase option was a real winner for me. It arrived flawless. No scratches. No scuffs. No marks whatsoever. Came in a factory Lenovo box with all the normal packaging and factory power supply.

It's very lightweight. The screen is fantastic. The touchscreen works. It *does* have a backlight keyboard (FN-Spacebar to toggle on/off).

Mine has Windows 11 Home in it in S-Mode. In the box are instructions to get it into normal Windows mode.

After initial setup and the million Windows updates to install, I used the Lenovo assistant app to update the system bios. For whatever reason, bios update aren't available through the normal Windows Update mechanism.

All that works

I debloated all the telemetry and such (search the Internet for Debloat Windows 11 and use the first GitHub link and PowerShell). Then I uninstalled all the preinstalled apps like Instagram and Spotify and The XBox Bar, etc.

Then I shrunk the windows partition to make room to install Linux. I use Fedora, but any modern Linux should work. No surprises. Hardware drivers were all in the default repos. (The machine has an Intel WiFi 6 card and Realtek audio.)

It's a great inexpensive machine with a 1080p touchscreen display and backlight keyboard, especially at the ""Used - Good Condition"" price.

HOWEVER, it has only 12GB RAM and *cannot be upgraded* (according to Lenovo's website). 4GB is soldered to the board. 8GB is in a traditional laptop DIMM slot (according to disassembly videos on YT). There is only a single slot. I don't know why it can't support a larger DIMM - I haven't tried to put a larger one in there.

There is a setting in the bios to make them function keys work normally (out of the box you need to press FN-F1 to get F1, etc. Otherwise you get the multimedia shortcut (volume mute in this example).

To boot from a USB, hold F12 when booting and select your USB device from the text menu. To enter the bios, press F2 (or possibly DEL) when booting.

I'm replacing a heavy, 9yr-old, flakey 17"" HP, 900p. So I'm thrilled with how much lighter, cooler, and quieter this Lenovo is.

It's clear that this is just a 'luck of the draw' and some in the batch have it; some dont. IMO, Lenovo should stipulate which ones do and don't as this is an importnat feature for many. (eg. Lenovo E15i or something).
This is an excellent laptop. The Intel processor plays better than the AMD one, we have found, since AMD tries to install display drivers which aren't compatible with external displays hooked up to this laptop. No issues with the Intel one so far.

Replacement screen and charger,"Easy to setup. Love that it comes with 1 year free of Microsoft office although I wish it would last forever. Browing using internet explorer is a bit slow but works just need patience. You could download google chrome and that might help with the issue but you would need to switch out of S mode which is what the laptop comes in. But I decided not to as I don't browse the internet much. The laptop indicates that the best mode to use is Windows 10 S-mode so I left it as is. I bought this item mainly for school purposes and I have no issues in that regard. Runs office and pdf files fast. Would recommend if you do not browse the internet much and want this for studying as you might find it slow with browsing but fast with doing other work. Shipping time was excellent and item came in good condition. Charger cable is short, so if your outlet is far away from your work space you might not be able to use while charging.

,"This is a basic laptop for a child or someone that needs this for now. It can play videos in 1080p on youtube but takes a few seconds to switch between full screen videos and page view videos. It can also do some light web browsing as long as there are not too many tabs open (more than 4-5) and as long as the web page is not full of videos/ads.

When it comes to this laptop you get what you pay for, and a better cpu and more ram would be greatly appreciated. This is a machine for people that need a cheap laptop with access to windows and their suite of applications (word, excel, powerpoint, ect).

If you can do without the full windows experience and can use google docs or windows apps on chromebooks then I would recommend getting a chromebook with better minimum specifications instead.

,"For the price, it's not a bad laptop! I was skeptical about buying a laptop online, and one that isn't a Dell or Toshiba (I'm very picky about my electronics). But because of the Covid-19 Virus going around and with many electronic stores closed, I needed to improvise and buy a laptop for my work from home obligations. This is a very nice laptop. The battery life lasts a few hours on a full charge (about 5 hours, if I remember correctly) and the setup was fairly easy. This product does come with that S mode on it, but it was easily removed (a web window popped up on the website and allowed me to change it within a few seconds). My only issue with the laptop is that it tends to run a little slow sometimes. But it's not to the point I'm having to wait more than ten seconds. So I rate it a 4 out of 5. Would definitely recommend."," April 2, 2020",5.0
Basic laptop for school or youtube,"I really thought I got a raw deal on this one - the specs are low, but I knew that when I bought it - but this laptop seemed to underperform significantly, running very, very slowly and being completely unable to multitask (like two tabs) or even play video reliably. I ultimately realized that its performance was very heat-sensitive - which is an issue because this laptop does not seem to have a fan or any onboard cooling. None that works effectively, any way. Part of why it's very light, I suppose.

This can be resolved with mesh laptop cooling pad that has fans in it, powered from the laptop by usb, for like 15-20 bucks - I just got one and the laptop is running much better with it. It's a little inconvenient, especially if a major selling point of this is it being lightweight. But at least I don't feel like I completely wasted 300 bucks on this computer."," July 9, 2021",5.0
,"Very happy with this purchase, as my old laptop was..old. The only purpose for my purchasing this laptop was to pay bills online and to communicate with family and read the occasional e-mail.
Light weight, simple interface, small enough for most backpacks, sling bags, etc.
I didnt purchase this for gaming or for media consumption, simply a simple terminal for simple needs and the price point was spot on!
Its is fairly thin and extremely light, almost to the point I feel I need to pamper it, but probably don't.
The OS is Windows 10, which is all I need and with minimal tweaks got everything to a satisfactory setting (loving dark mode).
Is it worth your money? Depends on your use for it. If you just need a simple terminal for your day to day activities, that's what I think it's great for, if you're looking to play MMOs or download your entire discography, maybe a PC is what you're looking for."," January 23, 2021",5.0

This is textbook-worthy design incompetence. No way I could live with this as my primary laptop. Really unfortunate, because otherwise this looks like a great machine for the money.
--display: clear and bright, non-glare, large enough to avoid eye strain; however, extremely sensitive to viewing angle
--for most Office tasks the lower speed is noticeable but not too bad
--wireless connectivity: I struggled to connect with Bluetooth and wifi-enabled devices, but it finally worked

,"I've only had this laptop for about a week, so take that into consideration. First off it will probably be smaller than you are imagining. It is lightweight to me, it's the lightest laptop I have ever owned. It is very comfortable to walk around with, if you're using it for travel like on a plane I think it is perfect for that. It is pretty fast and I can run Bluestacks (Android OS virtual machine) plus video on multiple monitors with the CPU at around ~10% and memory around ~75% according to Windows Resource Monitor. The only real complaint I have is the touchpad. The thing has a hair trigger and is constantly ""left clicking"" on it's own. So you end up with highlighted text or sometimes pressing a button you did not intend to.

,"July 8th, 2022 Edit:
Linux on ChromeOS (Crostini) issues seem to have been fully resolved in one of the updates around ChromeOS 100. Starting up apps is faster, putting the Chromebook to sleep doesn't crash them, and increased battery drain is no longer noticable. I'm *very* happy with this little guy's performance. I will note, that the startup times vary dramatically between having only a few tabs vs having a few hundred tabs open. Just something to note.

Original review:
I have a big gaming machine for game development, but while it's not massive it _is_ heavy and the battery life leaves a lot to be desired. As such, I always like to keep an ARM-based Chromebook around for day-to-day tasks where I might not have access to power for long stretches of time. I have a few requirements for any Chromebook I buy. It needs to have a relatively powerful ARM-based processor, above-average battery life (right now the average seems to be around 10 to 11 hours), more than 4GB of ram, and ideally have a decent keyboard, trackpad, screen, and still be small and lightweight enough to be easy to take places.

One reason I specify that I need an ARM-based Chromebook is that they generate almost no heat, so there's no need for fans or huge heatsinks, and due to their RISC-based architecture, they use WAY less power than Intel/AMD's CISC architecture. The lowered heat also potentially means it'll degrade slower and since I mostly wanted this for away from power use, less power needed and less waste heat produced is a big deal. Often, as in this case, it also means the machine can be made thinner and lighter.

My last Chromebook (now 6 years old) began dying, so I began looking for a new one and found that very few still ran ARM-core processors. And despite ARM-core processors being cheaper and easier on average to make, I'm surprised that many of the ARM-based Chromebooks are priced closer to the higher end of the price scale. While I do think the price of this Chromebook is quite high for what it is, I think it's very reasonable amongst the many unreasonable prices found throughout the Chromebook market.

This Chromebook checks literally every requirement I had, though I might have preferred something smaller like a 12 or 13 inch, as my last one was a little small at 10.6"", but the 14"" of this one feels just a tad too large to be easily carried everywhere. That's something I'm willing to live with for the specs, though.

So far, the battery life has been amazing, the processor is so fast that unless you're purposefully pushing it, you likely won't even notice the difference between this and something faster. My gaming rig with its 8 core AMD processor and 40GB of ram doesn't handle Chrome any faster, though it can handle orders of magnitude more tabs being open simultaneously. The screen is quite good for the price point and it even handles Crostini (full Linux apps installed in a container) apps with grace and ease.

That said it's not all perfect, I've had a few issues with the OS bugging out or even crashing entirely. Nearly all of these are possibly attributable to Crostini (which is still in beta) aside from the first bug which didn't allow me to sign in with my personal account on setup, instead got stuck on a loop of quickly flipping between the wifi setup page saying there was no internet, waiting 1 second, saying there was internet after all, then going back to the wifi page insisting there was no internet before finding it again. I got out of the loop by continuing as guest and attempting to set up an account from there which worked fine. I did have one weird issue I never technically got resolved where I installed Telegram from the play store and docked it to the right side of my screen and docked the Chrome window to the left side, I then adjusted the width of both as far to the right as they would go. If I left the telegram window to check notifications or clicked on a notification bubble, it would resize back to taking up half my screen. Chrome did the same if I full-screened a video on YouTube and came out of full screen. I got around that by installing the Linux Desktop version of Telegram inside Crostini and it's worked like a charm since, though Crostini has issues with the Chromebook going into sleep mode which happens automatically if you close the lid so I'm not sure I can recommend that route to everyone. :/

All in all, I do love this Chromebook, it has more than enough power for the OS in its current state and has promised updates till 2029. Unlike many other Chromebooks on the market, I think this one will be able to handle anything they add to the OS in that time."," April 11, 2022",5.0
More than enough power,"It's a little heavy for its size, but a great experience overall. Very bright screen, backlit keyboard, up-firing speakers. The speakers are not as good as my hp 14a, but everything else is superior, especially battery life. Only 20% left? I've still got 3+ hours before it shuts itself off. The Mediatek processor is so much faster than a Celeron N4000 that it's hard to put into words, and Android apps are fantastic on this platform. The trackpad is one of the best I've ever used. I wish I had paid for a touch screen, but only once in a while. I tried using a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse, and it was unreliable, but it turned out to be the mouse, not the Bluetooth chip on the Chromebook.

My only problem is that the keyboard has a quirk: The space bar either skips (no space) or doubles (two spaces), regardless of my thumb angle or force when I strike it. I'm sending this unit back to Acer to see if the keyboard can be replaced with one better-made. I've had 4 or 5 other Acer Chromebooks and a couple of low-end Acer Windows notebooks, and this is the first time I've had a keyboard this bad from Acer; usually they're at least competent, if not actually good. External keyboards work just fine.

If my keyboard is a fluke, I'll be happy to recommend this as a daily driver Chromebook."," April 20, 2023",5.0
,"Awesome battery life. I'm easily getting 17-18 hours of screen-on, normal work day use per charge. Not exactly premium in terms of components and materials, but excellent value - the quality of the components and touch-points (keyboard, touch-pad, etc.) is better than the low price would suggest. This has also become my go-to travel laptop - no fear of loss, theft or damage (low replacement cost), long battery life for times when recharging opportunities are scarce, with entirely satisfactory functionality for basic computing and internet interaction."," July 2, 2023",5.0
Very Snappy Chromebook,"I was shopping for a replacement for my Asus C302C, which reaches its AUE date in June. The C302 was a great, feature packed model for not a lot of money. Sadly, it seems you can't get all those specs in the same package for the price anymore. At any rate, I'm a longtime Chromebook user, and I have a good understanding of what they capable of and what they aren't. So I researched a bit, knowing what I needed and what I can live without. I use mine for browsing, listenting to podcasts, and word processing. So I figured I could get by with the Kompanio processor, as I'm not doing any dev work or heavy image processing. The trade off is longer battery life, and I'm pleased to confirm the processor is a miser when it comes to the battery. I also knew I didn't need the touchscreen functionality, as I'd never once used it on my C302C, so I opted to save a bit of money there. The speakers are decent and the keyboard is good, though I think the C302 excels in both departments, though the keyboard is pretty close. I think the display is slightly better on the C302C as well, but again, it's good enough for my purposes. I like the size quite a bit--not too much bigger than the C302C, but greater screen real estate. It charges relatively quickly as well. I was happy to catch this on sale. Along with credit card points, this was a steal in the end."," May 2, 2023",5.0
,"I've been a Chromebook user for 7 years. My old one hit its end of life, so I ordered this model a couple of months ago and have been using it daily.

Highlights:

- Excellent battery life. The best battery life I've personally experienced on a laptop. Can go a couple of days on a charge.
- It runs cool. No fans, so no fan noise.
- Nice big smooth Gorilla Glass track pad. Very nice. Premium feel.
- Aluminum top cover with chamfered edges. The rest of the body is plastic but solidly built.
- 8-Core ARM CPU with a 26K Octane Score, almost twice as fast as my previous Chromebook which already was sufficiently fast.
- 8GB Memory. Many other Chromebooks in this range have 4GB.
- The device will receive Chrome updates until June 2029. 7 years. Nice.
- Wi-Fi 6 wireless
- 2 USB-C ports, 1 USB 3.0 port.
- USB-C Charging
- Thin. Under 3 pounds
- Very good keyboard feel. Backlit keys.

Other features:

- The screen is Full HD, IPS. Nice, but could be brighter. No problem at all for indoor use. Not really bright enough for outdoor (I tested it,) although the matte screen is helpful there.
- Headphone jack is there if you need one.
- The Chromebook comes with basic travel sleeve. Nice perk.
- The 720p Webcam is nothing spectacular but will get you through meetings
- Storage is a 64GB eMMC, not an SSD, but it seems fast and I have no issue with it.

Not necessarily negatives but worth mentioning:

- No HDMI slot. I don't really need HDMI anymore because Chromebooks can wirelessly cast the screen to my Chromecast. Or it can cast YouTube to my Roku. Beyond that there's always a USB-C to HDMI cable I could purchase if needed.
- No SD card slot. Would be nice to expand storage if needed in the future, but I suppose a USB flash drive could be used instead.

Could be better:

- Speakers - I guess I was spoiled by my Toshiba Chromebook 2 with fairly robust laptop speakers, because these Acer speakers, while up-firing, lack any bass and with music can be tinny sounding at times. They do have good stereo separation though. For voice, they're good and clear. But for music I will be bluetoothing to my external speaker or wireless headphones most of the time.

Summary:

Overall an excellent mid-range Chromebook! Highly recommended.

Update - November 2022: As I see other reviews have noted, occasionally the laptop will not connect to wi-fi when you first turn it on. Rebooting it resolves the problem and luckily Chromebooks reboot very quickly. (The issue does not occur when waking the laptop from sleep.)

Update - March 2023: The wi-fi connection issue has not occurred in a month or so, so it seems like they fixed it with a software update!"," July 17, 2022",5.0
"Amazing battery life, snappy Andriod app performance, good quality/price ratio.",Needed to replace our home computer that we occasionally use so didn’t want to spend a ton. It was easy to set up and works well. Reviews are good and the price was right," July 1, 2023",5.0
,"I purchased this to replace a 5 year old 14inch Acer CB3 that was powered by an Intel N3160 (a quad core from around 2016) with 4GB of ram. That Chromebook was due to lose support and had become quite lethargic even in normal everyday web browsing. I had originally planned on waiting until more Jasper Lake Intel Chromebooks came to market, but decided I'd give this ARM device a go as I've heard their previous chips, while not having the best performance, had amazing battery life. Thankfully, this new mediatek powered machine is quite snappy with its 8 cores (4 A76, 4 A55). And, thank the stars, it has 8gb of ram. Why other manufacturers continue to sell machines with 4gb of ram is now a sudden mystery to me as this new Chromebook absolutely thrives with the memory boost. 8 tabs open with1080p youtube playing, and this machine is not breaking a sweat. With 85% battery life remaining, the OS is reporting another 12.5 hours of runtime. Absolutely phenomenal.

Only a few things keep this machine from being a perfect 5/5.
The build feels less substantial than my old CB3. More plastic feeling than metal. This is offset somewhat by being physically smaller with the same screen size, and being lighter.
The speakers, while better than my old Chromebooks downward firing speakers, aren't mind blowing. They are just acceptable.
The smooth trackpad is not the most responsive. I feel this could be less of an issue over time as my muscle memory adjusts to it.

Random thoughts:
-Just browsing, watching videos, I've yet to see the CPU temp past 31 degrees C.
-The machine is, thankfully, fanless. Passive no-noise cooling is a personal requirement of mine when it comes to Chromebooks.
-The keyboard is perfectly fine, it even has 5 levels of backlight brightness.
-A fingerprint reader would have been awesome, and possibly knocked this up to a 5 star.
-I'm so glad machines are charging with USB-C now.
-This device comes with a USB-C charger produced by Lite-On with multiple output ratings from 5v/3A (15 watts) all the way to 20v/3.25A (65 watts). It might not get much use considering this machines runtimes but it should charge the device quickly.
-No micro-SD slot, but I don't think I ever used them before."," March 20, 2022",5.0

,"This laptop is great now, but when I first received it we couldn't set it up from the start bc it wouldn't connect to wifi. This continued for about 4 days. I could login as guest only and browse the internet but thats it! After Acer tech support had me do a full factory reset everything was OK and has been since. I live in SE Asia, 10,000 miles away from America so I'm guessing the laptop had a rough ride. If problems persisted I could have returned it to Amazon but with my experience in this country theirs a good chance it would have never made it. Probably end up in a customs employees home. I believe my experience to be unique, so don't be afraid of this laptop. Works great, super fast, nice screen, great battery and I'm very happy at the moment."," July 28, 2022",5.0

Fast and fun.,"I got this during Prime Day so it was 20% off the listed price.
Pros:
Extremely light weight.
great battery life. I'll use it for an hour or two each day and then close it. Need to charge once a week.
Runs cool, doesn't get hot at all for my usage.
decent amount of power for having multiple chrome tabs open with videos, google docs, etc.

Cons: It is a chromebook and attempting to install windows or linux is a chore/next to impossible (especially because its a new chip).
Very small storage space.

It's a decent chromebook.,"I've had this chromebook since July, and it has been the answer I needed. Lightweight but not tiny, it has the power to run everything I had needed to on it, including streaming. I have also been impressed with the battery life. One of the reasons for this purchase was to get work done or stream and chill with my legs propped up and not under me all day. The battery is so good I don't have to worry about finding a nearby plugin, it will easily last a couple movies. I binged a season of a show without it plugged in. This chromebook
has excellent bang for the buck."," August 25, 2022",1.0
,"I've heard over the years that chromebooks are perfect for those that just want to surf the web. Being retired, this chromebook is just the ticket !!

A simple adjustment like that should not be so complicated and so far I am unable to set up scrolling bars .I am not a techie but have many years of experience with computers I use the touch pad a lot and find the bars easier to use than touching the screen all the time.

,"I have had Acer computers in the past and they've been real workhorses that needed to be replaced due to obsolescence, not any failure of the computer itself. I expect this Chromebook will be the same. Sturdy, well made, and solid without being heavy at all.

Pros:
1. It does not get hot like my laptop when I have it resting on my legs and mess around on it for an extended period of time. This may be common with Chromebooks but I don't know as this is the first one I've owned.
2. The battery life seems to be great. I've used it for several hours, playing videos and music that I would expect to run down the battery, but it is still holding on. I have had it for just over 3 weeks and I haven't had to charge it yet. I wish my (another brand) tablet held a charge like this.
3. I love the touch screen. It is responsive and doesn't accumulate a lot of fingerprints. I also don't use lotion and keep my hands clean, so that helps. But just regular oil on your skin doesn't seem to be making marks all over the screen.

Neutral:
1. The built in speakers could be better. They're absolutely fine for a laptop or Chromebook, but I had hoped for better sound. They are CLEAR and you can hear dialogue with no issues, but I just kind of hoped for a richer sound. Not really a negative as this isn't really the type of product that would be expected to have amazing sound.

Con:
1. Is this really a con? Since this is my first Chromebook, I guess I didn't understand the limitations. I had hoped/expected to run some of my games on this (a Star Wars game in particular). It's available on Google Play, but doesn't run on the Chrome OS platform. My mistake for not looking into this a little bit before obtaining the Chromebook, and I don't think this is really a con as much as it is a warning that if there is something you REALLY want to play/use this Chromebook for, make sure you can before you purchase.

Overall, this Chromebook is amazing and does 99% of everything I had hoped. I'm very happy with it, and wouldn't hesitate to give one as a gift, or buy another one when I ultimately need to replace this one.

One final notice: Before you buy ANY Chromebook, be sure to check with Google to see how long that model will be updated. Once the updates end, you have to plan on replacing. This particular Chromebook is set to be updated until JUNE 2029. You have PLENTY of time to enjoy it, and no worries that it will be obsolete within a few years."," April 10, 2022",4.0
Horrible. Died after 3 weeks!,"This Chromebook has made my life easier. I do some light, freelance work-from-home stuff while simultanously keeping my two kids (2 and 4) alive and well, which can be a challenge. Having this super lightweight, speedy, and uncomplicated machine has helped me to get my work done more efficiently, even when I can only do things in short bursts.

It is so light weight that I can easily carry or move it one handed, opened or closed, without any tension on my wrist. Perfect for yanking it away from little sticky hands.

The ability to seamlessly go from touchscreen to touch pad has greatly improved my efficiency and both methods are really responsive. This is especially helpful as I tend to spend more time using my phone these days rather than a computer so using a touch screen is often second nature. I don't know how I'll go back to using my non touch screen laptop.

Set up was easy, it takes you step by step through the process and as long as you have your passwords handy, its pretty quick. It effortlessly connected to all my google data with just my log in, and I was able to easily add more of my accounts.

The case it comes with is well made, thick without being too bulky and the book sits nicely inside, just enough space that getting it in and out is a breeze. I like storing it in there in between uses so my little ones can't easily break it by tossing it off whatever surface I thought was high enough to keep it out of reach.

The battery life is great, far superior to my laptop. I have even left it open (on a game, i'll admit) while I tended to a child, only to forget it for hours and it still had plenty of life left.

I took off a star (or rather, half a star if only Amazon would allow that) because I have had a few issues with the internet dropping frequently (it was only this device that had issues, not my internet itself) and then when I shut it down, I couldn't start it again. I was worried I had somehow bricked it already after only a couple days of owning it, but a google search on my phone taught me how to do a hard reboot using the keyboard and that got it up and running (and so far seemed to have fixed the internet connectivity issue."," March 24, 2022",4.0
,"I picked this up to have a ""around the house"" laptop that my wife and I could just pick up and use for a casual search or food / grocery order. So far this thing has more than done the task, so lets get into what makes it what it is.
First of all; I have both the touch and non-touch models. I chose to use the touch model as my wife sometimes likes touch screens and for evaluation purposes I wanted to test ""all of the features"". Everything else between the two laptops is otherwise the same.

Secondly; The performance is much better than I expected. I have dabbled in some ARM powered laptops/mini PCs in the past years and have always been disappointed in one way or another with the performance. That isn't the case with this laptop though; the performance is honestly on par with the Pixelbook Go, which is pretty amazing considering the price differential. Pages load fast and video playback works without dropped frames from major services. Videos start quickly and multiple tab browsing isn't detrimental. This is the first ARM device to do FishIE Tank w/ 500 fish and WebGL Fish Tank Demo with 1000 Fish, gets around 43fps on 5000 fish which is worlds better than a couple years ago. Overall CPU performance isn't far off of the SD845 from testing that I did myself before writing this review. Attached are some screenshots of the actual performance.

Third; Battery life was astounding. Honestly I used this thing for about 5 hours straight with only around 30% battery left when I started.... it had about 5% left when I finally stopped using it but I was sufficiently impressed. I have a variety of other laptops and nothing gets battery life like this for my heavier multi-tab web browsing.

Fourth; The screen is definitely mid-grade but that is to be expected at this price. The screen is bright enough and responsive enough for video playback and light gaming with streaming services (which it worked surprisingly well with). Color accuracy is okay and response time is also ""okay"". I say that because I have tons of experience with different screens from different places and on different tiers of devices. Considering the price tier while testing this; the screen is at least on par with most other devices in this class.

Lastly; The speakers are ""okay"". While they are upward-firing and as such are not a problem when the laptop is sitting on my lap. They work well enough for regular videos, but they are lacking in bass and other midrange... they sound somewhat tinny especially at higher volumes. There is no comparison to something like the Pixelbook Go in this aspect.... So I didn't use this laptop very much for watching videos unless they were just informative videos. The volume also doesn't go high enough to really be able to use it in a large room with other background noise (like my exhaust fan over my range). However when the room isn't so loud, it works fine even in a bigger room. In a small room it can be loud, but it still sounds somewhat tinny.

As a whole; this laptop has totally fit our needs as what we expected from it. It sits around the house and sometimes isn't used for a whole week and it is asleep so if I open the lid it just turns on instantly. There is a lot to be said about that because no other laptop does that including the pixelbook....

The value of this as an ""around the house"" laptop is quite high. With a good trackpad, pretty comfortable keyboard and great battery life tied to an affordable price (at the time of review) just makes it a hit out of the park win in my book. Of course some things could be better, but not really in this price tier..."," July 1, 2022",4.0
Speakers horrible!,"I got this laptop as a backup device. I plan to bring it to work sometimes to use as a secondary laptop or to use as a monitor instead of purchasing a monitor only. I also wanted to bring it with me when I am over at my boyfriends house on the weekend so that I could check emails or work on my small business.

The laptop is pretty light in weight. It is not as heavy as my work laptop or my Surface Pro which is a good thing as i'm planning to bring it around with me to places.

I also like the sleeve that came with it. Feels sturdy yet soft. Dog hairs are more visible on it as you can see from my photo but it doesnt bother me.

Reasons why I gave this laptop 3 stars-

Trackpad could be a bit more responsive. The screens color display is also not as vibrant as my Surface Pro which is a bummer. I would not want to edit product photos on this laptop. I do not think I would watch any movies on here either unless I had no other way.

This is my first Chromebook so I am not too familiar with how these laptops function but I did encounter a slightly annoying problem when I first got it. I was able to power it up and set up the laptop (account log in, wifi, etc) After completing set up, I decided to leave it as is until I had more time to play around with it. After a few days, I tried to turn it on but it wouldnt. I connected the charging cable and it still wouldnt turn on. I tried different outlets and different USB-C cables. Nothing worked. The charging light indicator wouldnt even light up. I had to chat with Amazon support to get some help. They sent me a link with multiple options on how to turn on a Chromebook. Eventually, one of the options worked.

I didnt even get to turn on the laptop more than once before a problem occurred. I dont really have high hopes for this laptop for the future. It's a good thing I wanted a laptop for seldom uses otherwise I would have been upset to be stuck with such a device."," March 29, 2022",4.0
,"Note: This isn’t the review you want to read if you’re looking for tech talk mumbo jumbo. I’m an average person who uses computers every day for average things. This review is written from that point of view.

Setup: I’ve setup about 5 Chromebooks in my lifetime and what I’ve observed is that it’s a fairly easy task. Especially if you already have a Google account. Setup is as easy as taking it out of the box, taking off any stickers, turning it on, and choosing your desired settings. Then you’re up and running.

Performance: I think it’s a great basic laptop for everyday use. It’s lightweight and that’s a wonderful feature in a 14 inch laptop. It’s much lighter than my 2015 Macbook Pro (which is typical), so it’s much more portable. It has a beautiful display. It’s clean and bright with a well-lit keyboard. Response time for just surfing the web and doing day to day activities is good. I’ve not done much outside of this but there are not a ton of other things a Chromebook is good for. There are limitations with web use and app compatibility, so any time you purchase one of these, this should be considered and understood. There are things they’re best suited for like school work, budgeting, and surfing the web. Then there are the not-so-great things like gaming, graphics design, etc. Know the difference. I guess I would say the only thing I don’t care for is the mouse pad. I tried adjusting it in the settings and never really could find a good groove. In comparing it to my 7 year old Macbook, it’s leagues behind, which is unfortunate. Don’t worry, I’m not going to use this review to preach about the differences between an Apple computer and a PC. I’m just stating a fact. It’s worth noting that it does have Bluetooth, is powered by USB-C, and excellent battery life. It also comes with a nice sleeve to keep it in, so you could check that off your list as well. The internal storage could be a little better, but again, I don’t see how it would be an issue considering what Chromebooks are best used for.

Overall: From my observations, this is a good laptop in its class. It’s a mid-priced Chromebook with a fast processor, good memory, and an awesome display. The mouse pad could be better, but there’s really nothing else I see fit to complain about. I’m also not going to count off for it because preference for this is different from person to person. You may also be accustomed to PC laptops whose mouse pads behave in the same way. As long as nothing funky happens, I think it’s a 5 out of 5 and look forward to continued daily use with it."," April 1, 2022",4.0
Easy to set up and probably all you need if you're not a gamer,"The hardware in this device is terrific! The touchpad and touch screen are both responsive and reliable. The keyboard is sensitive and accurate, with effective backlighting, great spacing and quiet (though not silent) operation. The screen is big, bright and easy to read. It works equally well for writing or for watching HD movies - with smooth video play and good sound. The machine boots quickly and performs most tasks with speed and precision.
There are apps to do almost everything I need - Including word processing, spreadsheets and presentations, all available for free in the Chrome app - the machine has limited online space, but there are ample storage options online. But the apps available are mostly very basic. I miss the full function of tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Scrivener and other pro level media creation apps.
This Chromebook works best when there is available internet. Its usefulness is seriously impacted while working offline.

,"Computers have reached the point where even a relatively low-cost Chromebook can compete with the likes of a high-end macbook for a lot of computer tasks: office productivity software, web browsing, video and audio entertainment. Really, unless you're a creator (video, especially) or gung-ho gamer, I personally don't see much point in paying big bucks for a high-end rig. A Chromebook like this one from Acer will equally tackle most web and app based needs – which is where most computer applications have gone or are heading.

In fact, I already do most of my computer interfacing with an Android smartphone anyhow (email, news, crossword puzzles). I do keep a Windows Surface around for writing on a keyboard and for doing small CAD projects in SketchUp. But I quite clearly see now that this Acer Chromebook can do these things equally well (Office and SketchUp are both web-based). I would honestly flinch at buying my Windows Surface if I had to make the choice again right now. I find this Acer Chromebook to be surprisingly capable.

I have been impressed. I turned it on, logged in with my Google account and it mostly just sets itself up. I go to Gmail and there's my email. I go to Chrome and there are all my bookmarks. I can go to the Play store and download my favorite Android apps. And I can run Android apps in windows that intermingle with Chrome browser windows. Beautiful HD touchscreen. Great sound from the built in speakers. You can even dock this Chromebook through the USB-C port so that you can hook up an external monitor and keyboard/mouse. It honestly does everything I need a computer to do these days."," April 8, 2022",5.0
all the computer most people probably need,"This is an excellent Chromebook!

I'm a veteran of the technical world. I've been working in technology in various capacities for over 25 years now and I've experienced computers and related devices of many-many varieties.

If you're shopping for a Chromebook you probably already know what they are and what they are for in the general sense. There are certain things that I use my Windows based laptop for, such as much of my technical consulting and development work. For most of my personal stuff, web browsing, and media watching stuff I definitely prefer this Chromebook. I'm not going to get into any OS differences or anything like that in my review.

The overall look and feel of this Chromebook is awesome. It's very thin and sleek. I love the silver color. It is light in weight but with the aluminum top-plate and quality materials it doesn't feel flimsy at all.

The screen has tiny thin bezels that just sort of disappear when I'm watching stuff on it and it has surprisingly good sound for the integrated speakers when not using headphones. The sound presentation is aided by the fact that you get no fan or hard drive noise at all! This silent operation is great because with headphones you aren't going to bother anybody else in the room even if you're on the other side of the couch.

A backlit keyboard is super handy for this kind of machine for when you're kicking back with it in a dimmed room. The wide-screen format is great for movies and shows and the display itself is incredibly sharp and vibrant. This Chromebook really is a media and streaming content monster!

Speaking of the keyboard, it is a really functional and fairly easy typing board among notebook keyboards. I'm a big guy with large hands and when keyboard keys start to get too small and too close to each other I start to have problems. This keyboard is a very functional size and pretty much the standard modern notebook keyboard layout. The (rather large) touchpad seems to have good exclusion set up such that accidental palm contact on it doesn't drive things batty when doing typing work, a big plus. If you are a student or someone that wants to use this Chromebook for writing documents and sending emails I think you'll be satisfied with typing on it. It is also very quiet when typing.

The machine overall seems very snappy and fast. We have a strong internet connection and pages load basically instantly. Streaming content plays smoothly and everything just works great. Chrome loves memory so the 8 GB of RAM helps with this a lot and the octa-core processor handles multiple operations gracefully.

USB-C charging and data port is great. Between USB-C, USB-A, headphone jack, and the wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity there is really nothing else I feel this laptop needs as far as modern connectivity options. Physical on board storage is a little light at only 64GB total (some of which will be devoted to the OS and installed apps and such) but this is in keeping with the Google/Chromebook philosophy of storing files and data on the cloud (Google drive and others) rather than on the local machine and therefore shouldn't be a hinderance for most users.

The battery life is AWESOME! A real strong plus for this particular model. It seems to just sip at the battery and go on forever between charges as compared to any of my other devices. The included charger is also of very high quality made by Liteon, though I feel the cord could be a bit longer.

Lastly, I'll note the included sleeve. This too is of very high quality as you'd expect from an OEM accessory. It has the main pocket for the laptop which of course fits perfectly and a side pocket for a few papers and/or a notepad. If you wanted to carry the charger though the sleeve might be a bit small but... with the kind of battery life this thing gets I can see leaving it behind a lot anyway.

I'm fairly cautious with 5 star reviews. I only give 5 stars to a product that has exceptional quality features, exceptional value for the retail price, or both. This is a 5 star product all around. For students, general at home use, for media streaming, surfing, emails and basic document work this thing is 5 stars for sure.

,"This boots up fast, allows me to browse the web, email, etc.. without having to lug around a heavy laptop. I like the operating system for the Chromebook. It is simple and straightforward.

"GREAT Chromebook, a total media monster","This Chromebook was easy to set up and had a couple of updates waiting. It has about 50GB of free space. This will primarily be a streaming laptop but the touchscreen is great.

It comes with a zip sleeve to store it and it has a second pocket for the power supplies. It's a solid casual laptop but I do wish it had an SD slot for keeping storage.

Overall for the money it's a good enough laptop and should provide basic entertainment needs."," March 25, 2022",5.0
,"Yeah, I dad joked you and I'm not even a dad. I'm the mom of the house and everyone had laptops except me. Honestly, I didn't want one. I'm the person who presses a screen assuming everything is touch screen. I can be challenged in many ways. Technologically challenged is one of them.

I was introduced to the Acer Chromebook when my children had a year of virtual schooling. The school assigned each child one. I saw how easy they were to use. Light. Portable. Quick to charge and held that charge. I also saw how they held up to the abuse teens put their devices through. So when this Chromebook became available to order, I hit that yes I want it button so fast!!

I am thrilled I did! Never in my life did I think I could fire it up and start using all by myself. It's so easy to use. I am a Google person, so I was able to get everything I needed on the Chromebook quickly. Also- TOUCH SCREEN yeah yeah!!

Now I need to go to coffee shop and be one of the people tap tap tapping on their portables. Maybe look like I'm writing the next great bestseller. When in reality, I'm probably here on Amazon shopping.

I'm so happy with the Acer Chromebook. I'm now portable and unafraid!!"," March 30, 2022",5.0
Great everyday replacement for a laptop!,"I picked up this computer to be my backup. I am very pleased with this Acer Chromebook laptop. It is very easy to setup. You just turn it on and follow the directions on the screen. Once I logged into my Google account, it takes care of the rest (I was surprised at the ease of getting this computer ready to use). I like that this is compact and lightweight. It has a good display. It moves at a good speed as well. I was surprised by how quick it worked. It has a nice keyboard. I love that it is a touchscreen. That is a must for me. I can do everything on this laptop that I can do on my regular laptop. The screen has a beautiful display (so clear, good quality). I like that it comes with a laptop sleeve to store it in (or so I can take the computer with me). It has great battery life. I do wish it had an SD slot for extra storage and that it could be used as a tablet (fold the cover back). This is a good computer for streaming. I can work on my blog on it and so much more. I am very pleased with this laptop."," April 20, 2022",5.0
,"If you are in the market for a Chromebook, check this one out. Love everything about it. For style, it is sleek, lightweight, and love the large touch pad.
As to function, just log into your Google account and begin using it. It is super fast, easy to use. I love the feel of the backlit keyboard. The touch screen size makes it so easy to use.
The battery life says up to 15 hours and I got every bit of that time, if not more. I love that I can pick this up and use for multiple days in a row without charging it.
The screen is a nice size and so easy to see everything and read documents. The color really pops on the screen.
Love that the charger is a UBS-C and we now have many of these around for other devices. I prefer universal chargers.
This even comes with a nice padded zipper case to carry it with you. They really thought of everything.
This is a fantastic Chromebook.
If you are comparing laptops to Chromebooks, I have both and the Chromebook gets used more. It is always charged and ready for use. My kids use Chromebooks in school so they prefer to use it at home, love the functionality of Google docs and being able to work simultaneously with others on the same document. I could go on and on, but definitely worth giving a Chromebook and specifically this one a try."," March 26, 2022",5.0
Great laptop with a touchscreen!,its a nice laptop easy to navigate and the touchscreen is great," March 26, 2022",5.0
,"This is my first Chromebook, and I'm pretty impressed. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's quite capable. It boots up quickly, handles just about any browser-based app, and the battery life is incredible. And even with its decent-sized touchscreen, it's noticeably lighter than similarly-sized Windows and Mac laptops. The only things I wish that it had are a memory card slot and the ability to open it all the way into a 2-in-1-type tablet mode.

A couple of times, it seemed to lose its internet connection (although it was still connected to the wifi). A reboot fixed that. And this thing reboots in no time.

Out of curiosity, I installed Call of Duty: Mobile from the Google Play store. I wasn't really expecting it to run, but it did! I wouldn't try cranking up the graphics settings, but I'll be danged if this Chromebook handled the game just as well as, if not better than, any phone in its price range."," April 17, 2022",5.0
The Acer is aces in my book. My Chromebook that is.,"This laptop is on the smaller end of computer products, but if that is what you are looking for, it is great. It is very light-weight and carries well along with fitting into pretty much any backpack. The chromebook utilizes all google applications and functions quickly with little to no lag on anything. The screen quality and picture is very clear and in high definition. Overall a great product, especially for the price."," May 7, 2022",5.0
,"This Chromebook has a great battery life! I charged it once and left it for a few days in between starting it up and doing anything with it. It keeps a charge on sleep mode much better than my other devices. It looks like a laptop, but works and has the options of a Pad. It works seamless with Microsoft products but it's MUCH faster than my PC laptop. It's working well for gaming or school work. I have no real complaints yet!"," April 21, 2022",2.0
Great Battery Life~,"Setup took just a few minutes. I like that I can reply to text messages on this device. I like the ease of use, my husband is very 'tech-y' but I just like things to work and need them to not require me to read instructions. I'm just impatient. This fit the bill. I also like the size of it and that it came with a case. I tend to loose my chargers and this will help keep them all together. I have other Android products so this sync's well with everything else I own."," March 24, 2022",2.0

Easy to Use Computer,"I have to admit, I did not know the difference between a Chromebook and a Laptop before doing some research. Basically, the laptop tends to run Microsoft (or Apple) hardware/software ... whereas a Chromebook is a Google-based product, designed to work online using Google (Android) supported apps. The benefit of a laptop is the ability to work offline on hardware programs, ie: installed programs such as Microsoft Office, Excel, etc. While Chromebooks of the last few years have included offline work ability and storage, for older users who enjoy working offline, this might not be as ideal as a laptop.

Who should not buy this:
- Users who prefer to do their work offline without a learning curve.
- Users who love Microsoft products and don't want to use a go-around program to use that functionality.
- Apple product users who might want to integrate their portable computer/pad with devices within the Apple product line.

Who should buy this:
- Android users who want access to more programs/apps through app store without having to install programs on their laptop. If you ever wished you had a laptop that had the features of your smartphone and have a hotspot or access to constant data or wifi ... this is for you.

The two BEST things about this Chromebook:
- Battery Power. This is by far the BEST feature about this product ... it has amazing battery life. Different tests have showed an estimated 15 hours of battery life when browsing the web or word processing, etc. and 18+ hours of battery life with video playback (watching movies, etc.) This is one of the best battery life I've experienced for any laptop/Chromebook. You can literally use this all day without a recharge. It also recharges fast, in only an hour or two. If you are a frequent user during the day, you'll really love this machine.
- Budget-friendly high-end processor. When it was announced the Acer 514 was releasing, there was a lot of buzz about the MediaTek Kompanio 828 Octa-Core processor. This was designed to compete with Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors placed in higher-priced Lenovo machines. It is priced similar to Intel's Celeron-based Chromebook processors but offers better performance and battery life, even if it lacks certain other features of the Intel-based processors. For most users, this will be a more than adequate processor that is very reliable, although not particularly revolutionary. For a sub-$500 machine, it is lightyears of what you would have bought even 3-5 years ago. The 26,000 Octane score is impressive in the price range but likely nothing earth-changing.

The not so good features:
- This is not a great solution for gaming. The limits of the Android store for gaming apps are real and while some of the higher-priced Acer Chromebook offerings attempt to address this (Spin models) ... this machine does not. Serious gamers, power users and those with sporadic internet may want to think twice before buying this.
- The 14 inch screen might be a deal breaker for some. Although it does have a widescreen mode, some may find 14 inches too small for movie viewing, or working on spreadsheets. The speakers also are lackluster ... not too much different than an iPad's speakers, but certainly they aren't going to blow you away. It is nice that this has a headphone jack.

Some nice features:
- Gorilla Glass tracking pad and 5-levels of backlight settings on keyboard. (Keyboard is decent but takes some getting used to compared to larger keyboards/desktop keyboards.)
- Fast boot-up ... much faster than laptops, which have to run through operating system checks.
- Built-in virus protection
- Automatic updates and access to over 2 million apps through the Google app store.
- Bluetooth 5.2 and Wi-Fi-6 (both pretty impressive to find at this price point.)
- Under 3 lbs. and very thin, for great portability.
- 8GB Ram and 64 GB internal storage ... adequate for students and executives. Much better than the early days of Chromebook with no internal storage.
- Headphone jack.
- Fanless system offers low noise, especially when watching movies. Big advantage over laptops with faster processing systems.
- 3 USB ports, including 1 USB-Type C port on each side for ease of charging and 1 USB-Type A port.

Some negatives:
- Google-based tracking of literally everything you do when you use this.
- No HDMI port ... this makes it difficult to use with a portable projector without wifi screen mirroring. Given the battery life, this would be ideal for usage with a projector in a home theater, however the lack of an HDMI port makes options less desirable for this.
- No SD-card storage. While this is not a huge deal given the 64GB of internal storage (and additional 150GB through Google) it could make photo editing and video editing projects more convenient.
- Much of the bottom portion of this machine is made of plastic. This aids in being lightweight, along with aluminum, but makes it less durable. Probably fine if kept in a padded sleeve (included) or case ... but don't drop this!
- Some may balk at the patches needed for programs like MS Office. You can edit MS Office files in Google Docs, including their Docs, Sheets and Slides programs. This will allow you to work on Word, Excel and PowerPoint files and convert them back and forth, but for a purist, it's just not the same as working in that system. For other programs ... such as Scriptwriting or photo editing, you will not have access to the industry standard for script writing or Adobe's Photoshop line, which are not supported in apps. You will have to find a patch app, or conversion app, of which there are plenty ... but this will require research and choosing. It is not as simple as installing those programs on a laptop and those with less tech savy may not enjoy this.

Overall:
This is a very reliable and highly adequate Chromebook. What you get today is closer to a laptop experience than ever before at the relatively low price point of a Chromebook. If you are okay with Google's tracking and intrusive privacy policy ... and needing to find workarounds for certain programs and functions, a Chromebook is a good tool. This is an especially good choice for students and executives. Creative types who want to create content or do photo and video editing will likely stick with Apple products. Gamers will also possibly lament a purchase of this machine. Overall though, you are getting a solid processor, fast start up and an insanely good battery at sub-$500, which makes this a great value for the right person. Acer has always always been a player in the Chromebook and laptop industry, but never a leader. This brings it a step closer to leading in a particular category and is a great little pickup for a student, commuter or someone whose needs are filled by a Chromebook. Buy it for the battery and the reliable processor ... and you likely won't be too let down by any of its shortcomings."," April 5, 2022",2.0

Superb Laptop,"This is an internet lap top type of computer. You can download apps from the app store, surf the internet and do anything on the internet in a fast pace.

Videos load and stream quickly, youtube works perfectly, etc.

,"This was a big disappointment. While the specs are great, the screen size is nice, and the keyboard is not bad at all for a Chromebook, all those points are moot for me since it would not power up. I initially thought it was a bad charger, and it was not powering up since the battery was discharged in transit. However, the charger checks out as being functional, but the Chromebook will not take a charge or power up.

I tried several options that other Acer (and other brands) users suggested on various forums and YT channels, as well as info from the Acer site, without any luck.

While I'm sure it's a capable Chromebook based on the product specs, I can't give it more than one star since the one I received has no functionality other than being a paperweight. Or perhaps a door stop."," April 12, 2022",2.0
Very nice,"It's been a while since I've had a Chromebook, this is a good midtier option with a good screen, backlit keyboard that's pleasent to type on, and crazy battery life.

EDIT: I ended up returning this. My battery life new out of the box was 97%, which is really strange for a so called new device? Seeing all the other reviews about this thing suddenly dying, (especially out of the return period) I decided not to risk my money and time.

,"I ordered the Lenovo Thinkpad Carbon X1 to replace my old Dell XPS. It's a great computer and has fantastic functionality. There are two things I gripe about it, though:

1.) (small) The fingerprint recognition works nowhere near as well as other fingerprint tech that's out there. I have to try multiple times from different angles before the computer logs me in. I log on with my pin a vast majority of times now, but it's a wasted feature, sadly, because it could've been really convenient.

2.) (big) The battery life on this laptop is a half-step below being horrendous. My previous laptop was five years old and couldn't survive more than 5 mins. without being plugged in. This Lenovo isn't as bad, but I also feel like I have always keep it plugged in else the ""20%"" or ""10%"" warning labels come on. Maybe it's just my poor energy mgmt."," April 10, 2023",1.0
"Great computer, terrible battery life","I am so far very happy with my choice to get this laptop. I have it running Windows 10 + Ubuntu 22 as dual boot, and it is performing beautifully.

Strangely enough, despite the product description stating in a few places that the screen is NOT touch, mine arrived with a touchscreen. It doesn't bother me, as I don't use this functionality anyway so I won't notice it... but odd nonetheless. The screen is matte and sharp.

The battery life is the only thing that I wish was a bit better. It's certainly enough to get me through a work day, but only with using battery saver settings.

When you update the computer all other functions slow to a crawl until they are complete. So if you want to make this laptop your primary device, I suggest setting up your Wifi connection as a metered connection and also doing the updates overnight as it's going to take a very long time to complete the updates.

Also I defer updates for several weeks so this helps the laptops performance. Disabling the Windows Update service in Administrative Services (services.msc command in the search box) helps too.

Now when it comes to gaming, sure, this laptop is not equipped to handle that by nature. But it can game on a reasonable level. I have run Serious Sam 1 and 2, Unreal Tournament 2004, Unreal II and some other 3D graphical games and it runs them fine with acceptable default settings.

Of course you will want to purchase an external hard drive (make sure it's USB 3.0) in order to run the games as this computer only has a 64 gb SSD. You also can't upgrade to Windows 11 even though the laptop device manager says it has TPM 2.0 and I don't know why the graphics processor don't qualify this system to upgrade. Not willing to take the risk either to do an unsupported install either.

Overall this is a nice little system if you know how to get around its technical issues but if you are not savvy with computer issues and so forth this may not be the one for you. Have owned it for 2 years and still working fine."," May 20, 2022",5.0

""Con: Security comes at the cost of usability
The resilience of Windows 10 S mode comes with several drawbacks.

As mentioned above, you can only install apps from the Windows Store. That may not seem like a big deal at first (because surely the apps you need will be in the Windows Store), but there are a lot of things professional users need that are downloaded from the web or installed using other app management platforms.

S mode means no Adobe software, no Apple apps, no non-Microsoft video conferencing apps, limited to no third-party security software--in short, if it comes to a Windows PC via a third party it doesn't come to S mode at all.

That includes web browsers and that's a deal killer for many people. Windows 10 S mode users are stuck with Edge as their browser and Bing as their default search engine. To further restrict browsing matters, even if Chrome or Firefox were installed on an S mode computer it couldn't be set as the default browser, nor can the default search engine be changed.

,"Overall, I would say the laptop is great. It is definitely worth the price of around $300. It is small, lightweight (although could be more), responsive, looks great, smells new after months, smooth to use, track pad is pretty good,
overall good chromebook.
I'm not really too much of a Tech person but grew up with computers in my 20's mostly using it for school and personal stuff.

I had it for a few months now so my beginning concerns aren't the same as my latter ones. I'll try to go over really quickly the basic beginning concerns I had then go through with my impressions with months of use later on. 1366 X 768 isn't HD but it's acceptable. Processing speed is 2.1 ghz, never had a problem or issue with lags. 4 gb ram is okay, probably wouldnt do 2 gb. 11.6 screen, I wanted something smaller so this is a plus to me. Bit heavy with 2.64 lbs for a small laptop but it's okay, still my lightest one. internet connection is good and bluetooth use was good. Processor never had a problem with Mediatek. Convertible to tablet mode is a plus. Solid state so processes quickly which is a big plus. Battery life is great, I hate charging and finding an outlet, but this goes on for more than 8-10 hours, just doing school stuff, no videos. I would say I searched like crazy in the beginning. I wanted one main personal laptop and one small convertible laptop and this was the best convertible one I could find on Amazon. I compared like 20+ laptops over a week, I was really putting a ridiculous amount of time on it. But I had specific things I wanted in mine, like speed, aesthetics, smooth performance, and valued those more than other things. I wanted things to be really convenient.

I have started using chromebooks more because they are inexpensive and very convenient to use. They aren't too good for hardcore processing, but for school work or personal work, it meets all my needs. Whenever I use it, everything is pretty smooth and seamless. Start and shut down are almost instant. I have never had an issue with it's use so far. I think for me, the biggest plus is the elegance. It makes everything very easy to use, it looks great, it even retains its new smell after some months with light use. My other laptops have poor track pads but this one is infinitely better. I don't feel the need to use a wireless mouse as well. I ended up getting a screen protector for it for almost $20 because it was a touch screen. I like how it has a lot of features like hdmi cables, one usbs, even a memory card slot. I think for the price, it is definitely worth it. It feels like a very high end chromebook, although I generally wouldn't pay too much for a laptop in general because I don't need high processing. The buttons feel nice and smooth. There hasn't been much lag or delay time. Updates are easy and smooth. Screen is nice to look at and the colors are great. There doesn't seem to be much glare and it feels aesthetically pleasing. Yeah everything's really nice with this.

There are some things I don't like about it though. Originally, I had planned to use this as a tablet part-time because I didn't want to buy paper textbooks. I thought of using all of it on this chromebook, but it turned out to not be convenient because it was too heavy. I would use it on the train and my hands would almost immediately get tired trying to read. I would have to rest is down on myself, which isn't a big deal but wanted something I could read ebooks and pdfs on conveniently. I don't know if I will end up getting another one to serve that purpose. It also is a chromebook so it cannot download files and stuff. I don't particularly like that because that stops it from being my main computer. I don't like putting personal stuff on my drive, like my expenses or whatever even though it is irrational and I do it with some apps. Maybe I should, but the fact that everything is on my drive to see makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind that this computer cannot really do much without internet because I always have something saved on it. It has 64 gb of memory which I think is quite significant. I mean, if I couldn't put anything on the drive, I wouldn't feel that, but 64 gb + drive storage seems more than enough and I am trying to be a minimalist anyway. Yeah not that many cons.

Anyway, I wanted a inexpensive laptop but this definitely performs up to par with most laptops. Never had a problem with it so far months into my purchase but did want something I could use as a tablet. Would definitely recommend. Definitely better than a lot of the stuff I grew up with that cost 3x more. Best laptop I could find and really pleasantly surprised overall in many areas."," December 23, 2019",4.0

Great little laptop,"Full disclosure, I am not an IT professional but use laptops, tablets, and desktop computers daily in my personal and work life. This chromebook has far exceeded my expectations. This is my first time using a chromebook. I have had a week or so to really dig into the device. I own an alienware gaming laptop, but I find myself only using it now for gaming purposes only.

This chromebook is fast in my opinion. The speed is snappy and the device responds quickly to gestures and commands. I have yet to find sometime I can't do on this that I do on my windows laptop aside from gaming. One game I like to play requires windows, mac, or linux. Since this has an ARM processor it does not support linux applications at this time.

Design: This device is a bright attractive white chromebook. I find the design to be pleasing to the eye and appears sturdy even though it is made from plastic. I do not particularly like using it in tablet mode. The screen feels bulky and sometimes unmanageable in tablet mode. The screen quickly transitions to whatever position to place it in whether laptop, tent, or tablet mode. I personal find myself not even using my LG tablet for much of anything except when I need LTE internet away from home. Overall the design is great.

Screen/Input: I find the keyboard to be on par with most laptop keyboards. The keys are a little shallow and I feel my typing has slowed a little bit, but not by much. The IPS touchscreen is very responsive and rarely find myself having to touch the screen more than once for my intended gesture. Screen is bright in home conditions, but feel it would lack in more intense lighting situations, such as outdoors.

Ease of Use: The google play store makes this thing be able to do just about anything. I have not tried any intense applications. I use chrome, netflix, hulu, evernote, several banking apps, and various other apps. All of them are snappy responsive. The bank apps load like they are in phone mode, thus they are in a small window. The apps still work as designed. Netflix and Hulu playback is smooth and pleasant to watch on the screen.

Overall, I am impressed with the Google OS and this device in general. If your someone who is on the fence about the operating system, I suggest you give it a try. The battery life is good as well. When using my gaming laptop its always with a cord tethered nearby. I also understand a gaming laptop is far more power intensive. I have yet to use this chromebook while charging it. The battery has allowed me to watch 4-5 hours of netflix, talk on facebook, and text through my phone without ever getting critically low. I charge it at night and then never put it back on till the next night. This is a max screen brightness. I was also very surprised with the speakers. The speakers were much louder and not distorted. I honestly expected them to be cheap netbook quality that is mostly better just to never use them, but thats not the case with this chromebook. I do generally use a bluetooth headset. The bluetooth headset paired with extreme simplicity. I also set up my brother wireless laser printer with google cloud print in less than 30 seconds.

Google did it right and lenovo delivered a solid product. I did purchase this on sale for $200 but would have spent the $300. If your a web surfer, music listener, netflix watcher I highly recommend this. If you need windows intense software then go with windows. Otherwise I think you'll find yourself using this as your primary device as I have."," November 30, 2018",4.0
,"I bought this out of necessity for remote learning and classroom instruction. I've loved it so much that, for the first time, I've severed myself from a traditional desktop PC. It's lightweight and has great battery life making it perfect for my mobile work style (roving teacher).

My biggest issue is the port availability. It would be great if there was an option for Ethernet (because I'm still old-school apparently) or HDMI. I often need to project presentations in my classrooms, so I needed to buy a separate adapter that could connect to the laptop through the USB-C port on one end and hold the USB-C charger and HDMI cord on the other end.

The most useful ports available are USB-C for charging and USB-A for those still using flashdrives. There is also a standard audio jack and SD card slot, though I would gladly trade both of those for one HDMI port."," April 10, 2023",4.0

,"I was curious on what a chromebook had to offer since i never used or owned one and i'm in need of a laptop since i'm living somewhere else.

This chromebook is fairly light and small and gets the job done and there little to no wait time when you open the chromebook turning on automatically.

There a bunch of things i noticed while using it is you can link your phone with the chromebook in where once you previously log into the chromebook beforehand you can unlock your chromebook right after by unlocking your phone (both have to have bluetooth enable). To search up shortcuts you can easily click the search button on the keyboard and type in shortcut and it have it where you can search all the shortcuts you can do and what nice is any additional keyboard say a bluetooth one can also do some of the shortcuts.
Also there are options where you can close the laptop and you have two options you can either put the laptop to sleep or it just turns off the screen then there a option to lock it by closing it or not. nice note is if you have display off you can still listen to pandora,mp3,or youtube.

Also for those who are wondering - you can play minecraft, ragnorak mobile (not fully keyboard control it only for texting in chat so no WASD movement) and hearthstone on it so it have it nice touch but you cant use the split screen feature from chrome so that a bummer now for the drawbacks. Also you can use microsoft word, excel and powerpoint from the googleplay store but you would need a account for it or just use the free online version.

This is small nit pick - the screen is 720p yet it clear but it is noticeable when you use it long enough wish it was HD or 1080p also some apps are set to the 720p by default. the google play store youtube uses the quality of the screen while chrome youtube (basically youtube normally on browser) is more clear. Also skype doesn't have screenshare or sharesound so that a major bummer and skype seem to run slow on the chromebook in terms having people sharescreen their desktop it always come out blurry on some occasions and i have to minimize and reopen skype to actually see what going on. i haven't try video call yet so it up to debate. Lastly for discord from google playstore you would need to adjust some of the call setting for it to work. the default setting would cut you off mid sentence and random pausing in between.
Another thing is you can't adjust the idle timer it either it goes to sleep, display turns off or stays on there no option to change it and when you have option to lock your desktop it end your skype call so you would have to go into settings for normal use, call use, and game use.
lastly is your better off having your laptop go into sleep mode with locked instead of turning it off. when you shut it down the screen goes blank white then gets brighter and brighter then goes to black. it's just me being paranoid like it would be better if it just dims and turns off instead of going very bright then poof black not to mention if you usually play on medium to low brightness setting then having your screen go maximum brightness with no setting to change it get annoying not to mention when you open up your chromebook after shutting it off it adjusted your brightness setting as well as well a bright chrome logo before going into login. Mostly this is a nit pick since it bothersome when you are using it in middle of the night then when you turn it off it hit you with the brightest setting so i just end up closing it to sleep mode or shut off and look away.

All in all it a pretty good chromebook i just wish it had more options in the settings as well have priority app settings in task manager"," January 28, 2019",4.0

,"I bought this computer while on a trip to replace a different Lenovo computer that died while I was on deadline for an assignment while traveling. Fortunately, I was able to get this next-day Prime delivered to where I was staying in LA and began using it minutes after it arrived. To make this review easy, I'm breaking it down by main key features: display, keyboard, battery life, and build quality.

Display: For the price, I don't think you're going to find one much nicer in terms of resolution and quality. Incredibly, you are getting a true IPS panel with nice viewing angles. I've found that the low res matte displays on other cheaper Chromebooks are incredibly difficult use and lead to eye strain. I'm a personal believer in purchasing as much screen real estate and pixel density as possible -- it really does make a huge difference. Another huge plus (and I'm not sure if this across the Chromebook line or specific to this one) is the night mode that cuts out blue light and boosts yellows -- this is another hugely important feature for me, personally. Touch screen functionality works fine. Display cons are that the bezels are massive and with it being super glossy, there can be lots of glare.

Keyboard: Basically Lenovo has it figured out with keyboard layouts and feel. While it's nowhere near as nice as the Thinkpad keyboard, this one is laid out quite nicely and is easy to complete bigger writing assignments on. There's no backlight, which would be a huge plus, but for the price, it's difficult to find anything to complain about. The top row function keys will be familiar to those coming from the Mac ecosystem. Everything is very easy. The trackpad is also surprisingly nice for the price as well. Gestures work without issue.

Battery life: This is where this computer truly shines. I purchased this while I was traveling during the winter and needed to it to complete weekly freelance assignments and had plenty of battery life while on the road. Even when being back home laying in bed watching Youtube or Netflix, the battery lasts all night, and then some. I basically never take the charger with me because I don't feel that it's necessary (unless it's already low on juice). In terms of just general surfing and Google doc stuff, you should be able to get a couple of days out of the battery. If you're watching videos and streaming, it's still a good full day's worth of battery life.

Build quality: I've previously had an HP Chromebook and was not impressed by the build quality by any means. It felt cheap, almost like a toy. While this Lenovo Chromebook feels much more solid, I still wouldn't compare it to a Thinkpad or the higher end machines in Lenovo's lineup. Still, it feels quite durable and I've never worried about carrying it in a pack all day, or stacking books and other heavy items on top of it. The only thing that is kind of a bother is that the brilliant white finish does get smudges and dirty fingerprints on it. But that's more of a nuisance, not a flaw with the machine.

For the price, you really can't do much better. So long as you have reasonable expectations for what you're getting and how much you're paying, you will be very pleased by this product."," September 12, 2019",4.0
Nearly perfect,"This is almost a perfect device. 2 flaws. The first flaw is in it's hinge ability -- going back and forth from laptop to tablet mode wears out the cable, making it so when you return to laptop mode, the keyboard doesn't engage unless you shut the cover completely, causing you to have to sign in again, which is a drag. Eventually, even closing the lid won't restart the keyboard connection, and in it goes for service. I've had mine in for service 3 times in 2 years for the same issue and it would have been 4 but I had only purchased the 2-yr warranty and they wanted $86 for one more year, so when it crapped out the final time (just over a month after the last servicing) I bought a new one instead with a 4-year plan for $76. I have resigned myself to having to spend $200 + warranty every four years to keep myself in a device that I adore.

Before coming to this conclusion, I tried a HP 2-in-1 for a day but sent it right back due to poor screen quality and overall cheap feel. I'm glad I went to the trouble of trying something else because it made me appreciate how wonderful the Lenovo experience (screen, keyboard, overall feeling of solidness) really is, and I realized that I'd rather live with the hinge flaw than sacrifice the other quality features. I'll just keep it in laptop mode most of the time, and when I DO convert to tablet, I'll do so slowly and gently.

And now for the second Lenovo Chromebook flaw: the lid develops little cracks on both side edges about an inch above the hinge edge. When I noticed the cracks, I realized that opening the lid causes it to 'bow' a bit putting too much pressure onto the lid down by the hinge side. It turned out that the Lenovo extended warranty does not cover this so my solution was to start using a snap-on plastic cover and the cracks did not worsen. Then, I ended up with a new lid after one of the device services and with the plastic cover the cracks did not reappear. So getting some kind of stiff cover is a must for this baby.

My new Lenovo Chromebook is a Flex 3, which I cannot tell apart from my old C330. It just feels so good to have one back in my hands."," September 8, 2021",4.0
,"Regarding Chrome OS. This is my first chromebook so I'm still learning, but so far I'm extremely impressed! It seems like the chromebook was the computer I've always needed but never realized I wanted! Marrying the pc experience to an android compatible operating system is magical. Although I'm apprehensive about this browser-based computing, I've found it very easy to save and edit documents offline so I'm still able to work on the go. I can also connect it to my android phone, send and receive text messages with it, emulate old school video games (GBC, NES, SNES, GBA, and NDS), connect it to my bluetooth speakers and blast some jams. I regret not making Chrome OS a part of my life MUCH sooner!

Regarding performance. I've heard people say this processor is mediocre. I have to ask, what are those people even doing to arrive at the conclusion?! I have not once seen the slightest indication that this thing isn't *completely* competent for daily needs. Incredible response time. No lag when scrolling. Minimal to no delay opening apps. Stunningly fast start up time. I feel like it's a pretty outstanding performer, overall. Sure, it's no high end gaming machine, but who buys a Chromebook looking for advanced gaming capabilities? The bottom line: you click; the computer responds instantly. Really, what more could you ask for?

Regarding the build quality. It's a bit bulky in its ""tablet"" mode and lacks the premium build materials of high end chromebooks, but it still looks and feels great - certainly better than any laptop PC I've ever owned! The white color is gorgeous. The size is perfect. The keyboard is comfortable and the touch pad is large and responsive. If you look closely you'll see Lenovo coated the touch pad with a hefty clear coat to prevent wear and tear. As someone who immediately coats touch pads with contact paper to prevent damage, this is an impressive step, however inconspicuous to the average user. Additionally the hinge feels solid and smooth. The construction of the entire build just feels extremely sturdy. The monitor produces extremely sharp images with outstanding color. Although many people express dissatisfaction with the lack of 1080p and the larger bezels framing the monitor, I didn't even notice! If you're not planning to do professional photo editing, I doubt you'll notice either. (Side note: If bezels really concern you, consider the experience of flipping this into tablet mode and walking around with it while working. Wider bezels in this situation result in fewer accidental screen taps from fingers that are curled around the edges holding it.)

I absolutely recommend this chromebook. It's a steal at this price point, and stands to replace my quad core, 8gb Windows 10 laptop for most of my computing needs. Sure, it's not a 1080p monitor, lacks a backlit keyboard, and isn't made out of aluminum, but goodness gracious if isn't the coolest, most practical little laptop I've ever owned.

It was even featured as one of the best chromebooks money can buy as of Feb 2019 by Android Police and Android Authority!!"," February 9, 2019",3.0
First Chromebook. Very Impressed.,"I'm on the second week now of using the Lenovo C330 convertible Chromebook (there are multiple models on the site under C330 so I'm specifying it is the model with 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD, MediaTek MT8173C processor). I needed to replace my 9 year old Macbook Pro that was an excellent machine but just couldn't handle modern computing needs. However, I have a desktop for more intense computing needs, so I really didn't want to spend $1000+ on a new MacBook to browse the web, watch YouTube videos, read eBooks, watch Netflix etc in the evening. Cheap laptops in the sub $350 range are frankly almost all junk, so I wasn't really interested in buying one of those either. I don't want a tablet because I want a keyboard and I like to lie flat in bed and that's just not convenient.

Enter the Chromebook! So far, this has been an impressive solution for the purchase price of $231. Of course, Chromebooks have a variety of hardware and you need to do your homework to get the best experience. For about $50 more than lesser Chrombooks, this is an ideal middle ground solution. Within its comparable price range, the MediaTek MT8173C processor scores at the top as far as processing speed. Coupled with 4GB DDR3 RAM and a 64 GB SSD for boot speed, plus how lightweight of an OS ChromeOS is, this is a very well performing little machine for the price. Web browsing is snappy, YouTube loads very quickly and the Google Play store gives you access to all the apps you need. So far, all apps have loaded without any issues and function well. The battery life is remarkable - I've gotten 13-14 hours of use from it and still had 15% when I finally plugged it in. ChromeOS is super easy to learn/user friendly and reminds me of the user experience of a phone/tablet.

NOW - this machine is not a few things. It doesn't have a super high resolution screen, but it's a small screen, so it's not bad, but if you're used to a Retina screen it will be a bit lower in quality. It is fine and perfectly functional, but not exceptional, as a tablet (not the best touch screen response and obviously heavier than normal tablets and ChromeOS isn't as optimized for touch screen use compared to phone/tablet operating systems - think things like bigger front/back/X buttons - those aren't as prevalent on ChromeOS). The keypad is nice and sensitive but the click is loud. Printing is probably a pain but I have a desktop for that, so I don't care. So far, those are really the only cons I have found to this machine, but the pros far outweigh and you need to be realistic about features vs. price. It does a lot of things really well at the current list price of $251. It is not a $1000 laptop and you simply can't expect $1000 features from it.

I'm very glad I spent the extra money for this over the sub-$200 Chromebooks with lower quality hardware and no convertible/touch screens. The convertible/touch really makes it fun to use.

So, in summary: If you just need a machine to do run of the mill browsing, streaming, etc I think this is an almost perfect solution and an excellent value for the money."," February 8, 2019",3.0
,"Right out of the box, we got it set up and started checking on different apps. Every issue we had with the little Chromebook was resolved after we updated it, except for an issue with forever being stuck on the loading screen for Audible.

The issues we had right out of the box, which were fixed on update, were: Netflix was low quality (but every other streaming app worked fine), Audible would not load (didnt fix on update), couldn't scroll down on pages anywhere especially bad in Settings, and we had to minimize the Settings app every time we selected something otherwise it would pretend it was stuck. Now that its working after update, I have NO ISSUES that would cause me to be upset with the device. No Audible is fine, I use my phone for that 99% of the time, we just wanted to have it on the Chromebook because it was an available app, so no big deal on our end. I will say that I don't use the volume speakers on the Chromebook (I use bluetooth headphones and speaker) but it is about as good as a cheap device is expected to have (it wont rock your world musically, no real bass), some people might have an issue with this. I also do not use it to play any sort of game, so I don't have any feedback on using it that way.

Altogether, I would buy this again in a heartbeat! Great product that handles me having many applications and Chrome tabs open at once.

Update: After a few days of hard use, the machine is running excellently. Its able to work efficiently with multiple tabs and apps running at the same time, including video and audio streaming. My only complaints are that the screen wobbles slightly if used as a touchscreen in a laptop-position, folding it back into a laptop-position from a V or tablet-position feels concerning as the hinge is sort of tight and it makes you feel like you might break it if you go too fast or carelessly, and when using the keyboard the edge of the chromebook can bite into my wrists if I rest them on it but that's easily resolved by not placing the chromebook in a position higher than my hands sit. Still a great machine and would buy again!"," March 19, 2021",3.0
Excellent value for the money!,"Okay so I'm going to preface this with I've been on the search for the perfect laptop/chromebook something portable and takes up minimal space for my other half. I did research and this was in the top 10 and it said blizzard white which he likes so I pulled the trigger. When we got it the box says blizzard white but when he opened it the color was the abyss blue and looked like a different model. He still loves it.
I will update when he uses it to see if there is any issues or any likes or dislikes.
It was very disappointing to me that he got the wrong color. I am not sure if the model number is even correct as what the box was saying it should be. I will update if I can find the box the chromebook came in.
What could cause the wrong item to get in the box when the box itself has the right name listed on it?"," October 27, 2022",3.0
,"Good quality laptop. This is the second one I purchased for my daughters school work. I was disappointed I ordered the white one and they sent black. If white was on back order an email would have been nice letting me know with the option to wait or except the black one however that didn’t happen. They just sent the black laptop assuming it would be all okay which does not make me want to but again. It was rude, a couple minutes to email me would have been more respectful as a customer who has not just bought one but two now from y’all."," January 14, 2023",3.0
Works great... after updating.,"This is my first Chromebook. I decided to get one because most of what I use a computer for doesn't require anything more heavy duty than what this has to offer. I'll still use my other computer should I require things like Photoshop or those heavier use programs, but since I got my Chromebook a week ago, I haven't even touched my other laptop.

The Pros:
Battery life - When it estimates that I have 12-13 hours of battery life, it means it. I can stream videos and multitask and it doesn't sacrifice that time. Time to charge is also impressively quick.
Speed - I open the lid and it's on. It's that simple. No waiting for everything to load up. I had to do an update and it took maybe 10 seconds, including restart time. I know internet will vary depending on network, but I'm able to easily multitask and it's not dragging. I'm currently casting a video to my TV and have multiple tabs open on chrome, all with no lag to the video (which would often happen with my other laptop).
Ease of use - If you're already a chrome/google user, switching over to a chromebook is a piece of cake. I didn't have to transfer anything, and I do have to eventually back a few more things up to my Drive, but again, that's easy. Getting used to more app-based programs than desktop ones is easy enough too. Almost everything that would have required a windows download has an app version or a way to use it on a chromebook as well.
Screen/Tablet mode - I haven't toyed too much with the touch screen, but it's a nice perk. I like being able to flip the screen around and turn it to the side and bam, it's a big tablet. So far I've only used it like this once to read some comics, but it was nice. Brightness is great too. I usually have it down halfway or less even.
Size - I was worried about it being too small because my other laptop is somewhere between 13-14'' but it's a really great size. This thing is incredibly light too. Much lighter than I'd expected. Love it.

The Cons, though extremely minor:
Caps Lock - Mostly, it's a ""getting used to"" factor that I just haven't quite mastered yet. There's no caps lock key, and the search button that replaces it isn't terrible, but I think I'd have preferred to just have the caps key. (You can just press alt+search for caps lock easily enough though)
Backlighting - my other computer had backlit keys. Totally an ""extra"" that's not necessary, but regardless.

And that's it. If you're looking for something light and simple for everyday use, this is an incredible choice."," September 27, 2019",3.0
,"I wanted something that I could transfer photos to and onto another device but this doesn't have the slots in it that I'm aware of anyway. I did read descriptions but I just got overwhelmed looking at hundreds of different chromebooks/laptops so I went with this because of reviews. It doesn't support some of the memory cards and photos (says to download windows or something similar). I'm sure the problem is me, not being tech savvy but I'm bummed. It is a lot smaller than I anticipated. I've only used it a few times and make sure I wash my hands before hand and the white has yellow ish spots on it already. I think I should have went with a laptop instead. The Levano we bought our daughter is great. I think my expectations were too high. No fault of the company."," October 29, 2022",3.0
Wrong color,"Wow, what can I say. For a product that is 5 months old let me list the ways that this has been a terrible experience. Amazon, it's not your fault. You need to stop selling Lenovo's products, though.

1) The first day out of the box the unit failed to start up properly. We used Lenovo's chat service and after zero troubleshooting attempts they decided that the unit was broken and we should mail it back to them for a repair/replacement. It was Christmas morning, you try telling that to a kid. After a few google searches, we figured out the obvious issue, and it started up beautifully. This was my first foray into the most unhelpful customer service experience I've ever had. Send it back??? OK, or try everything else first??
2) After 3 weeks my son opened the unit and there was a hairline crack in the touchscreen from one corner to the next. This never affected functionality, but one day while bored during COVID-19 lockdown, I again (stupidly) opened the chat and asked whether the screen could get repaired under a warranty because the reason for the break was not because we had done anything to damage it. The answer was no, I should drop it off at BestBuy and someone there could decide whether the repair would cost me or be free. Not during state lockdown, thankyou - a mother needs it for her kid to do distance learning. The chat agent entered a ticket on my computer to document the broken screen but of course left out the information i provided on how it became cracked and that it was fully functional. How nice?
3) In April, my son opened the laptop up to start his schoolwork and the Google chrome page continually refreshed every 8 seconds. There was no way to prevent this from happening as the touchscreen and mousepad would disable every 5 seconds of the 8, so we could do limited things in those 3 seconds we had control of it before it re-set. So I tried chat. Big mistake. Lenovo chat does allow you to specify that you need troubleshooting and technical service help, but the person I got said they don't do that online and to call someone. I called the phone number. Here is the ridiculousness that ensued:
a) First lady says it's a software issue, not a hardware issue and my hardware is under warranty but software is not. I need to upgrade and pay for software support so that she can troubleshoot the issue for me. Pay? Why? You have not asked me a single question to determine what could be going on. Though she reassure me repeatedly I have reached the right help center and can correct my problem, since I’m unwilling to blindly pay for her help for their product, She says she can't help me but to call a different phone number where maybe someone can help me for free...?
b) annoyed, I call the next phone number. Might I mention each time I call this place so far their phone message immediately says they're having high call volume and to schedule a return phone call, but I humor them and wait this time. The phone is answered within 2 minutes. High call volume...or you want to avoid helping customers because you do not have one tech on staff who actually can do that? The person who answered the phone asked for my name and phone number and then hangs up on me.
c) I call another customer support number and the person who answers sounds vaguely like the first person I talked to but if it was she plays dumb after taking my name and computer serial number. This woman tells me that the reason google chrome is refreshing itself every 8 seconds is A HA! because I have a cracked screen on the unit and it’s not a functional touchscreen any longer (are you some omnipotent being?) and this Entire issue is surely due to the crack in the screen so she can't help me. No other questions asked by the way. I say that is absurd, I can use the touchscreen for several seconds without issue and it’s been fully functional for months. She tells me to take it to a local place to have it serviced because she can't help me over the phone. When I remind her that my state is in COVID-19 lockdown, she tells me that it's pronablu, definitely a Google issue and to CALL GOOGLE for support with their software!
d) not that google would have helped rather than send me back to Lenovo, Google is closed due to COVID-19 and their contact through chat was impossible to find online as well.

We ended up powerwashing the unit. Fixed. Why couldn't one of the 4 people I contacted with Lenovo run down a few scenarios with me and end up at the same conclusion as my 10 year old did?

,"We really like the wide viewing angle good sound system . Younger people may not appreciate that as much as we do because our hearing & sight is not as good as it was many years ago, Resolution could be better but for the most part is easy to see and hear.

My wife has been using the C330 almost exclusively after we purchased it. There are several android apps that do not work well but the android apps she needs these days do work OK and that is all that is important for now. She did not like using the GMAIL app, so we turned on the linux option and installed the linux version Thunderbird mail . Thunderbird mail takes a little longer to start up than the other apps but seems to work very well. This is an ARM device so many of the applications that work on the Raspberry Pi etc will work on this device. Once installed the program icons can be placed on the shelf to be started as any other app..
There is/was a learning curve as the Chomebook does not have all the settings where android devices normally keep the same settings.

It appeared you must keep it in developer mode to run apps from unknown sources making it less desirable for us to access the Amazon App store. Switching to and from developer mode requires a complete reset, but as soon as you log in to Google your settings and apps are restored. It takes a few minutes, so it is not something you want to do often.

In tent mode the Lenovo Chomebook is nicer than using the Samsung 8.1 tablet on a stand. We used a wireless mouse at first but found it easier to just use the touch screen. However the touch screen does not work as good as the regular android devices we own. We did play with the ""text"" mode where you write on the screen and it adds it to your document, fun but not for us.

Overall, we are happy with the purchase, we did not want to spend a lot of money for a high priced quality Chromebook until we knew we would actually like using it. As others have noted, this Chrome box is pretty nice, for the most part easy to use and probably more secure than most regular laptops. Google's Chrome OS is getting better but in it's current state of development it is good enough for us to use every day."," February 27, 2019",3.0
Good quality,"So I have a love/hate relationship with this laptop. There's a bunch of pros and cons. Let's get to the pros first. Pros : Fires up instantly as soon as turned on and easy setup as soon you first get it. Takes less than 5 minuets to setup. Easy to navigate and download apps. If you already have google chrome setup on another device everything comes back just the way you had it. Really simplistic in design and is light weight and durable (it probably can handle a modest accident without breaking or the screen shattering). The screen does not wobble like some other 2in1's. Apps and other programs do not lag and fire up quickly. Now here is the dreaded cons. Cons: If you are not used to a Chromebook it is a super awkward OS! Nothing made complete sense to me about the OS from the start. I got used to it but it still is weird to me. The sound quality is subpar, it does not get loud enough for my taste either. The screen resolution is about as good as the original Kindle fire HD resolution circa 2012 - pretty much years behind to the current technology resolution. 64 gigs storage is simply not enough space to store music, pictures and movies, if you have google cloud that's your best bet to go about storage. This is not a gaming device, if you are into gaming the hardware can not support an intricate modern video game. The battery life is definetly not 9 hours! Maybe if you just left it on and did absolutely nothing with it, it can stay alive for that duration of time (on the flip side it does charge up fairly fast, about 1hr 30 mins). Lastly, it just does not have the feel of a laptop compared to Windows OS or Apple OS. I find myself getting frustrated with the way everything is setup on a Chrome OS.
Overall not horrible, but not great. The reason I purchased this Lenovo was the price and wanted a touch screen computer to hold me over because my old HP touch 2in1 is all cracked and busted up. So I will use this one just for browsing the internet and other simplistic functions. Great for a kid to use and keep them occupied but as an adult it lacks functions that a real deal OS can provide. Expect a major downgrade if you go from Windows to this OS and just in general just a major downgrade. This would be state of the art if this was released in the early 10's(?). Hope this was insightful. 4/10 is my grade on this efficient yet awkward device."," August 18, 2021",3.0
,"I bought this product less than a month ago for my son’s online schooling.
At first it worked perfectly. Great computer. Loved it. Then it stopped charging. Which I was bummed about but understand that things happen. I knew I had purchased the warranty and I am still within the 30 day Amazon warranty so I thought this would be an easy process to get a replacement.
Boy, was I wrong!
I spent 2 HOURS being passed back and forth between the Warranty company and Amazon. Amazon offered a replacement but said I needed to file a claim with the extended warranty company. When I spoke with the warranty company they said that Amazon would need to replace the computer because it was still within the initial 30 days, understandably.
After speaking to an initial amazon rep who was unable to help me and kept asking me if I’ve tried plugging it in in another outlet, I asked to speak with a supervisor and was transferred to Mary.
Mary offered the worst costumer service I have EVER received from Amazon. Mary proceeded to tell me to “wait until I get to 30 days, then file a claim with the warranty company.” I expressed that I already spoken with the warranty company and they already knew of the situation and that they said that amazon needed to replace the computer. Mary kept repeating the same information saying that after 30 days the warranty company would cover it. I told her again that would not wait until the 30 days and that my concern was that the warranty company would not cover it because they had already been informed there was an issue with the laptop prior to the 30 days. Mary then proceeded to make a 3 way call to the warranty company and was told exactly what I told her by the warranty company. The warranty rep literally told Mary “this is not the costumers fault, please take care of the costumer and replace it.”
When we hung up with the warranty company Mary continued to give me the same information over and over again.
I told Mary (while she was talking) that I was very frustrated and that I didn’t understand why she continued to repeat herself she said “can I talk?” I was shocked that a supervisor felt that was appropriate! When I asked to speak with another supervisor or her supervisor she told me “I am the last point of contact.” 🤣 So apparently Mary runs Amazon, guys. She’s the last one we can speak with.

To be clear Amazon offered me these options:
Replacement through the warranty company, but the warranty company wouldn’t replace it and Amazon didn’t have it “in stock.”
$60 dollars for “repair costs” when I asked if I could repair the computer. My son is using it for school so we don’t have the option of not having a computer. But when I asked what that would do to my warranty Mary could not answer so I declined because $60. Not to mention that would not cover a repair.
Then they offered a full refund, which I ended up taking and agree a refund is fair. One note about the return is that Mary wanted to schedule a UPS pick up for tomorrow to return the computer but my refund would not be in my account for 5-7 business days. I made it very clear that because of the confusion and lack of helpfulness I will not be sending the computer back until my full refund is in my bank account. I can only image the nightmare I would experience should I not get my refund and I’ve already returned the product.

My main complaint is the costumer service from Amazon. It was HORRIBLE. To be passed around for 2 hours only to end up on the phone with the rudest “supervisor” (Mary) was mind boggling. It was very obvious that she couldn’t care less about my situation or helping me. Then for her to tell me that she is the “last point of contact” was frustrating and inappropriate.... but also quite comical. You are not the running the show for Amazon, Mary. I think somebody needs to clarify your position, sister. You are clearly confused. Some ( and by some I mean A LOT) of management & customer service training would be highly recommend for Ms. Mary. Her performance is screaming for help.

Amazon has been easy to deal with in the past. It’s unfortunate that this is the treatment I received on an item that is a necessity in our household right now and was a pretty pricey purchase.

The warranty company was easy to deal with and very polite."," August 18, 2020",5.0
Horrible costumer service.,"This is the closest thing I've seen to the perfect Chromebook. It's fast, the touchscreen works well, there's plenty of local storage (32 and 64GB versions exist -- I went for the 64GB model) if you want it, and the battery life just goes on and on. This is the first laptop I've owned that goes for days between charges with usage time of a few hours per day. You can even use it as a tablet if you want to: just flip the screen around and there you are!

I have a few Intel Celeron-based Chromebooks of similar age from competing manufacturers and this thing handily outperforms all of them.

A few releases of Chrome OS (around the version 76-80 mark, and again sometime around beta versions 87/89 when the kernel was upgraded to version 4.19) demonstrated buggy behavior on this platform, but that seems to be all gone now.

If you're buying this today, you'll want to be mindful of Google's automatic updates expiration policy, which is set in mid-2025 for this model. (It'll be here sooner than you think!) You can still use the Chromebook after that time, though you will not get any further software updates. Intel and AMD-based Chromebook models can sometimes be made to run other operating systems. Hopefully someone will do the same for ARM based models such as this Lenovo C330. I can definitely see myself still using this after 2025, if the battery and SSD hold out, and I'm fairly sure both will.

There's really only thing I've ever found lacking from the Lenovo C330, and that's a backlit keyboard. Had Lenovo equipped it with one, this truly would have been the perfect Chromebook."," July 11, 2021",5.0
,"When I write a review for a product I tried to be fair. First of all let me say that I have purchased an Acer 11 inch Chromebook and returned it last week because it was well terrible. I read a lot of reviews on the Lenovo, watch a lot of YouTube videos and I was fairly confident that I would be happy. I have to say I was not disappointed. The device shipped in typical Lenovo fashion and not too fancy packaging power cord small little booklet actually a pamphlet and the device itself. First things first the bad. There's not much bad to say about this device if you expected to be a gaming machine you will be disappointed it's a Chromebook. The display is IPS although it's slightly washed out the colors but sharp enough. The main drawback is the lack of ports there is one USB 3.1 and of course the USBC that is used for the power cord. You could use adapter and have 2 USB ports but this was she would be much better suited at least in my mind if it had at least two USB ports. Secondly the SD card, full size by the way sticks out way past the form factor making it not really a good way to store data. Unfortunately it doesn't go all the way in the body and it should. And last is it's White blizzard white is the only at color it comes in I don't know what's up with that. Now for the good and there's lots of goodness here. The quad-core mediatek processor is fast, at least fast in terms of what a Chromebook is. The touchscreen highly responsive the touchpad does not feel cheap and works really well although full disclosure I like to use a mouse. The case itself is made of plastic but it feels solid is no bending just a really nice quality filled to the tablet / Chromebook. Nice a tablet / Chromebook because it really is a Chromebook or laptop it doesn't work real well as a tablet it's a little big keyboard is on the other side but it works real good in tent mode that's for sure.

Outstanding Value in a Chromebook,"Had to pick up a new Chromebook/Laptop device to start doing online therapy to help support mental health services through the COVID crisis. Like many, my income has been cut so was looking for something that would ""do the job"" inexpensively. Got a great deal on this device and based on reviews and previous experience with Lenovo I took a chance. Could not have been happier for the past 3 weeks since receiving it. (well, it doesn't run the NEWEST OS version, so I guess I could be a LITTLE happier, but this works great). Then last night I needed to plug it in and recharge (this thing will go forever on a full charge by the way - I was seriously impressed). At first it said that it wouldn't charge while turned on since it was a lower voltage charging device - but this was the Lenovo charger that it shipped with. Then it stopped charging altogether. I've tried different wall outlets, even switched the cable that plugs from the converter part to the wall - no luck. Was able to recharge it overnight plugging it from a standard usb-c into a wall adapter with it off, but unfortunately as of this morning the OEM power supply is junk. and now I have just a few days to decide whether or not to return this for refund or try to pick up a new power supply somewhere. As I still need this for work I'll probably have to do the latter, but I hate to have to sink money into it already less than a month in use. Other than that though - the device itself is awesome. And well worth the additional money I did already spend picking up a hardshell case and keyboard cover to protect it.

What I expected and a little bit more,"I bought this computer in Feb of 2019 and it's still going strong! I'm pretty rough on it and while I have managed to crack the casing in a couple spots, it still works perfectly. The touchscreen looks nice and the computer is still as fast as can be.

The touchscreen is super nice to use and I like the keyboard as well. The size is perfect for me and I like that it's so lightweight. The ability to adjust the screen from computer to flat out or tablet or a tent is great.

It took me awhile to get used to storing photos and things like that. I do store a ton of stuff on the computer and don't have any extra storage added and haven't run out of space yet. I can view most documents and if I need to create or edit a Word Document or something like that, I can do it online with Office or Google's apps. Same with PDF's. The only downside is that you can't run Microsoft programs, obviously. However you generally don't need to do that now anyways, with everything being online or available via app.

I can download a lot of apps from Google Play, so that's nice! Game Apps can be downloaded too.

The web camera's quality sucks pretty bad but it's functional. The volume can go up pretty high too!

I use this computer pretty heavily during the work day and it easily manages to last through my 8+ hours of work entertainment without needing to be charged, even when I'm mostly running Youtube.

,"When they first came out, I was a strong critic of Chromebooks. To me, a Chromebook was nothing more than an ADM-3A incarnate; connected to the cloud, instead of a mainframe. But as Chromebooks started adding Chrome OS, Android and now Linux; I decided that I should get one, to carry around with me on trips; that did not require me to have access to a Windows Pro system.

The hardest decision I had to make about this particular purchase, was if I should get the 64gb ""Amazon's Choice"" unit that was actually being sold by Lenovo; or a more expensive 32gb unit sold by other sellers, because their product titles included the words ""Newest 2019."" Rest assured, when my 64gb unit arrived, the ""Manufactured"" date on the box was only 2 weeks old.

While you are waiting for your order to arrive; it helps to pre-create a Google account, just for the Chromebook. You can setup & customize a Chrome profile exclusively for use by the Chromebook; and then ""Add"" your other Google accounts to that Chrome profile. This will speed things up when your Chromebook arrives, because you can just log into that Google account & Chrome profile; and your Chromebook is ready to go. The advantage of this, besides setup speed, is that you won't clutter your Chromebook's login screen with more than one account choice.

Be sure to update your version of Chrome OS. As of the late March 2019 manufacturing run, version 70 comes installed. You need at least version 72, if you expect to run Linux, from the get-go.

For right now, the only thing that really surprised me about the unit, which may or may not be a ""standard Chromebook thing,"" is that I have (until now) never seen a physical keyboard that was labeled with lower case letters on it! Speaking of the keyboard, for those who are wondering, the keyboard is disabled after the hinge goes beyond 180 degrees. It does feel ""weird"" however, to feel the keyboard pressing against your fingers or lap, when using the Chromebook in tablet mode.

Frustration of Google passwords is unending!!,"I'm new to Chromebooks but not new to computers. I am an old soul who learned DOS and so I'm most happy with something like Linux and therefore the Chrome OS being based off Linux and the ability for newer Chromebooks to run Linux and open source programs like LIbreOffice are extremely important to me. I recently spilled a whole glass of wine right onto my HP Chromebook 14 therefore I had to buy a new one (even after taking the laptop apart to dry it out). This Lenovo is beautiful. The quality is far greater than the HP piles of junk out there. The screen is magnificent for such a cheap little thing. I like the fact I can use my Logitech Blutooth keyboard and therefore hopefully never spill anything again. That's the beauty of Chromebooks though - everything was backed up online and I didn't really lose much. Picked up where i left off with this wickedly good Lenovo. I have used a lot of machines - including Macs and Dell. I don't feel the price for those things are justified in anyway unless you are a full time graphics dev or designer and need heavy overpriced programs like Photoshop. There are superb alternatives with open source. Inkscape, GIMP, Scribus...and more. Cheap Chromebooks can't do everything but they are getting better all the time. I highly suggest updating Chrome when you buy this laptop, restart it then open settings and turn on Linux Beta. Learn about the programs you can run and how intelligent Linux is at installing them.

Overall I love the size of this Chromebook. The screen is clear and gorgeous. Resolution is wonderful. Wish the laptop had more than one standard USB port but I'll manage. (I back up all locally kept files onto a USB drive or sometimes Google Drive). Touchpad seems responsive. The ability to use the laptop as a computer or tablet is fluid and no complaints.

,"For the price, it is a good buy. My father had an issue with using a regular laptop for streaming (he needed something with an HDMI cable to plug into his TV). The laptop I gave him was of good quality, but had an older hard drive (not SSD) so it would take awhile to boot up, and it wouldn’t run as fast as I would like. This is a simple chromebook that is just what I would consider a decent option, boots up quick, runs pretty fast, stream quality and screen is acceptable, and it comes with a full size HDMI port, on top of usb c which is what it uses to charge as well. I also created a new google account and logged it into my own computer so if he does need help, I can use googles remote access to help him remotely! I would recommend this for anyone who either needs a laptop for web browsing, a light workload such as document creation or online school, maybe a younger child’s first “real” computer. It is also pretty compact and light so I would recommend for traveling, however I can not speak to the durability, but it seemed stable. I would not recommend it for gaming unless it’s gaming on a tablet. I would also not advise anyone who’s in need of a lot of build in storage."," December 25, 2021",4.0
Great for a tablet replacement for older parents,"Ok my review on this Chromebook will be detailed

1. The screen:
Considering this Chromebook is very cheap. It's a nice screen, it has good quality, not so great color accuracy, but it's still great. It's touchscreen and it responds great. No problems at all.

2. Keyboard:
This keyboard let's me type fast. Really fast. It has good travel, it feels quick. It's very nice!

3. Audio:
Here is where I spected a downside but no, it sounds good. Not very loud to be honest but good quality. The speakers are down facing like most of the regular laptops nowadays but it sounds very good, even if you put it on the bed.

4. Battery Life.
You can easily get 14-15 hours of light use(Surfing on the web, reading).
10-12 Hours of moderate use (working on documents, watching YouTube videos, Netflix)
8 hours of heavy use (Gaming)

5. Look & Feel
Looks nice! No problem, it looks like a Lenovo laptop, very formal, very professional, it does have that Chromebook logo that screws up a little bit the professional look but that's fine.
It feels strong, it wont fall apart very easily, it won't scratch easily too because it's like hard plastic but very well made.

To finish I would like to say that if you're on a budget and need a laptop that can get the job done, this is for you. Remember this is a Chromebook and ChromeOS is more like it was an Android tablet with steroids . You can't freely install any software here, like Microsoft Office, Photoshop, etc, you're basically stuck with the web versions of those, but again this is to keep it simple."," November 10, 2019",4.0
,"Picked this up to replace my old Toshiba Chromebook that I dropped, and which was approaching the end of it's auto-update Chrome life.

Runs fine if you're a Chromebook user, which I am. First Chromebook I've had that runs apps, and I very much like using the streaming apps - Hulu, Netflix, etc. - and reading apps such as Scribd and Kindle. But news apps like the Washington Post or NYTimes just don't look right to my eye, so I tossed those and default to their web page.

First touchscreen I've had as well, and it's pretty handy scrolling through web pages and turning the page in Sribd. However, I'm a bit obsessive about fingerprints on my screens, so that drives me nuts. I picked up a Moshi TeraGlove which does the trick. But that brings me to the only real beef I have about this unit, which is the tremendous black bezel surrounding the screen. Fingerprints and smudges really stand out. I understand that might be something necessary for tablet mode, but I hate tablet mode, although I love folding the screen back for tent mode. From looking at the tablets of folks I know it's obvious fingerprints and smudges don't bother a lot of people. I'm adjusting.

The display for video is fine, although large-font text is a bit fuzzy on certain sites. Maybe I need a new prescription. I've never met laptop speakers I like, so these sound no better or worse to me. The white plastic looks a bit goofy, but for $250, if you're a Chromebook fan there's nothing wrong with this device."," November 8, 2019",4.0
It's very good for the money,"For the money, it's amazing.

I used to use a Windows 17"" laptop as a full-time remote worker. It had a giant hard drive, lots of RAM and the faster i7 Intel Processors. But, all I really need a computer for is the internet, Google Drive, Doc, Sheets and Slides.

So, I bought this and haven't looked back. The Chrome OS is pretty durable. I certainly don't have all of the problems I used to have with Windows updates and the freeze ups, etc.

It does slow down after awhile and you need to restart at least once a day, and, the more Android apps you load, the more chances you will have for problems.

The screen isn't the most brilliant but it's fine for office work. Gaming and watching media, it's adequate, but not great.

The touch screen is pretty accurate, although when you have window on top of window, sometimes you can't select the correct window on its corner by touch and have to use the touch pad.

I originally loved the idea it was a flip model, but, I hardly use it in tablet mode. It's too cumbersome I guess, or maybe it's the fact the keys are still active underneath and your hands or whatever you place it down on can press against them. Not sure, but I don't use it that way.

Bottom line: if all you need to do is make a living on the internet and use Google Cloud services, then this can't be beat."," January 29, 2020",4.0
,"I've had it for a few months now and I really like it. Any of the negatives below relate to software - specifically MS office. Otherwise no complaints.
1. It requires some patience as you transition from MAC or Windows to the Chrome OS. Just take your time. I recommend not buying this as a gotta-have-today replacement. If your current PC is failing but still operating & you want to make the switch, do it before your PC fails. That way you can wade into your Chromebook.
2. Excellent value for the price.
3. The software is mostly free and available. My Chromebook email syncs my iCloud, Gmail, and Comcast accounts seamlessly. Note: I do not have business accounts on this device.
4. Not to get geeky, but I did the research on processors. Their MediaTek MT8173C outperforms the other available processors in benchmark tests.
5. Get 64GB, not 32 or 16. Space fills up fast, especially if you aren't good deleting emails, etc.
6. Add a low-profile thumb drive. With another 64, 128, or even 256 GB, storing pix is a breeze.
7. 2:1 is nice, but I don't use it much. Nice to have feature for me.
8. The battery is great. With the multi-use type-C connector, it doubles as a port. Now, at 67%, I still have over 5 hours left.
9. Screen res is very good. Clearer than other laptops I've had. No complaints.
10. MS Office. I just don't like working on-line with Office. First, this is a small screen. Second, no matter the Internet connection, it is jerky - the cursor doesn't move smoothly. I wish I had an acceptable substitute - have tried others, but they are worse.
11. Mouse? No problem.
12. Plastic build some purists complain about? No problem, the fit and finish are excellent. Just don't drop it.
13. Some lap-heat, but not too bad.
14. The keyboard is crisp and responsive.

Yes, I would buy it again. For $257.99 today, it's a steal."," March 3, 2019",4.0
Nice little Chromebook,Lenovo has much better build quality then some of the other cheaper devices in this class. This is my first chromebook. I have to say I am impressed with the amount of actual work you can do with this thing. It is VERY versatile. The performance is above average. Being able to run Linux with ChromeOS is a huge bonus. If your a former sysadmin you might want to consider this for a utility. The battery life is fantastic. The performance is good. Switching between table and laptop mode is a breeze.

,"I love this lightweight Chromebook. The computer folds into a tent shape, a laptop, and a tablet depending on how you want to use it. The OS is fairly quick. The screen is bright and crisp. The only drawback is that the memory card slot is not a mini, but a full-sized slot so you have to use a card adapter. This makes the memory card stick out instead of being flush with the side. I feel it is a design flaw. It isn't enough for me to give it a bad review, but I wanted you to know about it. I use this little lightweight computer in all three modes, and I am very happy with the touchscreen in either tent mode or tablet mode. When used as a tablet there is a mechanism that turns off the keyboard so you don't have to worry about accidentally pressing a key. It is very easy for me to use in my lap with no worry I will accidentally press anything. I was easily able to download games from Google Play and have been having a good time, in my spare time of course LOL, playing games. You can use One Drive and Office 365. Overall I would recommend this all-in-one solution to anyone who needs a lightweight alternative to a small laptop and separate tablet."," April 10, 2021",4.0
Great Value!,"Some pros: For the price, this laptop is great for internet browsing and if you have a google/gmail account, you can connect everything to it. I use google photos on my phone, so it was great to have the photos back up into the laptop with just a push of a button. There was also a promo that came with extra space on the google drive for 2 years when I bought this chromebook. The touchscreen works pretty well, although not as smooth as iPad/iphone level, but i was able to use Adobe Sketch and Whiteboard apps when I needed to ""draw"" for my class or studying.

Battery life is pretty good. I ran YouTube videos (some on 1080p), charged my phone, and read on kindle at the same time (sometimes switching between different reading such as adobe pdf viewer apps) and the battery lasted a good solid 8 hours, so if you need a light laptop with a long battery life, this is a good option.

Some cons: The memory SD slot - I didn't like how when you place the memory card in the slot, it sticks out, but I hardly use it anyways so it doesn't bother me too much.

Another thing, some apps aren't compatible as they are on a windows/apple. Even if the apps are available on Google Play, some of them either didn't load at all or they would not work as smoothly as it would on a windows / apple. The good thing though is there's a lot of alternate programs, but if you are someone that needs a laptop for strictly a particular program/app that may only work on windows/apple, this might not be for you.

Overall, for the price and quality, I think this is a great laptop. I use it for internet browsing and for my school work to read pdfs and for studying and I'm satisfied with the product."," March 20, 2019",4.0

,"First and for most this is a Chromebook, not an intel laptop that can play most games on. Chromebooks do not run Win/Mac and if you do not know much about this, I suggest you research that before buying this. This 2-in-1 is great for me because it allows me to have a tablet when I want it and a laptop when I need it. I enjoy writing and doing genealogy and I don't necessarily want to sit at my gaming rig all the time. It does have a google play store so most of anything you can download from there, you can put on this Chromebook. The battery life is fantastic! The touch screen is responsive and you can hook up a USB mouse, external drive, or any other peripherals you may need. (Not at the same time, I'm already looking to get a USB Hub because there is only 1 USB port) I also enjoy this because you can link your Android or Google msgs to this and text right from here. Makes it nice when chatting with family about researching family!

Suggestion: this could easily be for a child or anyone doing general web surfing/communications online with light streaming."," May 15, 2021",5.0
"Great for online, streaming, emails, communication and genealogy (which is what I bought it for)!","So, disclaimer: I'm not a heavy computer user, meaning, all I mainly use a laptop for is browsing the web, using spotify and discord, and sometimes some Microsoft apps which i'll talk about.

Pros:
The battery can last a whole day of good usage, the screen quality is great, the keyboard feels nice, and my favorite thing: it's FAST! I was so sick of my slow as a** clunky hp laptop. It takes probably like 10 seconds to start up, and pages are quick to load. The laptop is a perfect size for sitting on your lap or putting in your bag, and it's really light to carry around.

Not necessarily ""cons"", just stuff that takes a little to get used to:
Like with any chromebook, most of the ""apps"" are just in another window of the browser. That being said, I managed to find a good add on to chrome for spotify and discord, but if you use other apps that you're used to on pc or mac, you might find that a problem. With microsoft apps, you could just use the online versions and they work fine for my student purposes. The touchpad feels a little inaccurate, but after some use, I got used to it. The two-finger scrolling and zooming feels nice, though. Also, the speakers are kinda washed out but again, I got used to it.

Actual cons:
It's crashed on me a handful of times already... normally, it's just a little annoying since it starts back up so quickly, but recently I had it crashed TWICE during an online midterm. Really though, that was just awful timing and otherwise I don't really mind it.

Any issues I had at first were gone after time passed. Despite the issues, I'm giving it 5 stars since it's such a high quality laptop for the price. If you're a student that wants something simple, I recommend it."," March 8, 2019",5.0
,"I've had this chromebook for a couple of months now. It is really nice. I love the size & how quickly it boots up.

I only have issues with certain apps force closing down on me like Microsoft PowerPoint, OneDrive, or even Word freezing up. WhenRecently when I try to use Word Online, the status bar (that shows the feedback, zoom in/out) is very high up on the entire webpage therefore making it hard to work. Sometimes the play store has lost connection & cannot reload unless I Restart the chromebook twice. These things are really annoying & my chromebook is up to date.

But it has a long battery life & barely heats up. I use Netflix online because the app version takes up the whole screen and I hate that. Recently I can see the pixel resolution is low online and I have everything set to HD 🙄 So idk what to do about these issues besides power wash... But the thought of having to re-download all my apps & sign in & wait until OneDrive cloud is recognized so I can back up things is a pain.

I do miss my full Windows Microsoft office & the ability to freely download any app from a different source without going into developer mode."," January 24, 2020",5.0
PERFECT little simple laptop for students,"What a wonderful computer! Like the other reviewer said: unbox, turn it on, connect wifi, sign into your Google account. That's it!

It's like a slightly larger tablet (11"" vs 10""). Substantial without being heavy. I did not experience wrist fatigue. The touch screen is very responsive, and it's easy to switch to the keyboard. All the extensions you're accustomed to using with the chrome browser on your PC, are available on this Chromebook, with the addition of the same apps you use on your phone from the Google Play Store. This Chromebook is lightening fast. What's not to like?

As I found out, there are limitations (unfortunately). Chrome OS is not compatible with Adobe products. Nor can it run programs written in Python. The other substantial limitation is that it wouldn't work with my older Brother printer/scanner, which I love.

These three limitations ended up being a deal killer for me. I was forced to return this great little Chromebook. 😞

I use the ebook library management program called Calibre (written in Python) in conjunction with Adobe Digital Editions to download and store library books. I cannot imagine life without without access to my books. And there is no acceptable solution available for Chromebook at the time of this review.

The purchase of this Chromebook was intended to be my only computer, so their was no alternative. So a deal killer.

As far as the printer goes: my Brother wireless laser printer/scanner is about ten years old. It works perfectly. And it's the printer of my dreams. There's no reason to replace it. It couldn't be installed on the Chromebook, and it wasn't Google Cloud compatible. Deal breaker. 😕

So as long as you don't have these kinds of limitations, go for it! It's a great little Chromebook computer!

Unfortunately, I was forced to return it in favor of a Windows based PC."," February 14, 2019",5.0
,"I got the 64 Gig Lenovo C330 Chromebook. You will be very pleased when you buy this product, and I am honestly saying that.

Other Chromebooks are like 500$ and up, and this one performs just as well as it's competition. It's not like a home PC or laptop for storing a lot on it, but the 64 gig is a lot of room, more than my phone has.

I got this for the soul purpose of mobility and school, now that classes are pretty much partially online these days. It's 2 1/2 pounds which is nothing compared to my home laptop so I don't break my back walking to class. It also boots up in less than a minute. I tried it for my McGraw Hill online books and work and it works just the same as my laptop. WiFi connects fast and even better, the Chromebook has Bluetooth so I can connect to my speaker or headphones whenever.

It does download apps from Google play which is nice. It is also not quite a computer, but not quite a laptop either, it's somewhere in-between.

I recommend you get the 64 gig, because when updates come that may take up some more space, and it'll prevent the Chromebook from becoming laggy.

Also the interface is extremely easy to use. Chrome is very similar to Android. Icons are clear and you can find anything with ease.

Haven't tried art or stylus on it yet but when I do I'll update my review! I am a very happy college student, portable, affordable, worth the price!!"," January 15, 2020",5.0
Good but New to chromebook,"The touchscreen is very responsive with multi touch. Battery life hasn't gotten below 50% in several days of usage. I code all day long sometimes running programs that max out the system, read .pdfs/webpages and watch YouTube. It charges very quickly. I would recommend getting a USB hub to extend the ports if you plan to use it with a mouse and keyboard as it only has one port. The keyboard is surprisingly responsive and tactile and doesn't feel crammed for its size. The front of the keyboard facing the user is somewhat sharp but gives an ergonomic curve for using while rested in the lap. The screen is reasonably bright and dims to a very low brightness if desired. when utilizing all system resources (running a really big program) the bottom can get a little warm but isn't very noticeable or unbearable and the system remains stable with thermal throttling (lagging when the laptop is struggling with a big task but doesn't seem to lock up). When in tablet mode there is a little play with the screen as it doesn't lie flush to the bottom of the laptop but holding in a proper position makes this unnoticeable and I find the tablet experience quite enjoyable overall. This doesn't feel like a dated chromebook and the mediatek processor is impressive for the price and battery.

For power users: there is seemingly no swap space allocated by default but I haven't maxed out main memory yet running several programs with > 10 tabs open in chrome."," February 25, 2020",5.0
,"First week with this Chromebook.

Likes: light, battery life, value, general usability - no major compromises as far as I can tell switching from Windows 10. The convertible functions great. I switched to tablet mode and rotated to portrait mode while reading a PDF doc the other day in the office and felt like a boss :)

Not so much: Keyboard feels and sounds cheap. Same for the mousepad - functions fine but is loud on click. For me working in tech and surrounded by people on macbooks, this chromebook looks nice, but lacks that last mile of refinement. Another low is it only has a single USB slot (should have read the specs more closely) which for me means when I work at home I'll need to invest in some sort of docking solution to connect external mouse and keyboard. The screen is OK - so far no major issues with resolution (1 exception ironically enough is the Google account icons on the top right - the circular profile pic is pixelated on the edges). There is a wide border between the edge of the computer and the edge of the screen - about 1 inch on top, left and right and 1.5 to 2 inches on the bottom.

Overall I'm still giving it 4 out of 5 because for a home computer, this thing is awesome. But for me as my primary work laptop, I think I will need to look into going up a tier to one of the nicer Chromebooks."," March 20, 2019",5.0
"Fabulous Chromebook, but not a PC","Disclaimer: I'm normally a die-hard Mac person. But I'm also a middle school teacher. And if there are two things that do not go together, it's an expensive personal computer and over 100 twelve to fourteen year-old kids. So I decided now was as good a time as any to use some of my saved-up Amex points to get something that I wouldn't be *that* bothered by if the kids accidentally knocked it off a table or dropped something on it. I mean, they're middle-schoolers so they're not exactly known for their agility and grace.

It's fairly no-frills. The box is cardboard. The instruction manual is a folded piece of paper. There's really not much to figure out with a Chromebook and I'd rather pay less for the machine than more for a glossy box and an instruction manual that kills paper and serves no purpose.

Right out of the box it booted up nicely. I logged into my Google account and was instantly able to access my email, photos, etc. The touchscreen is nice because sometimes I'm just lazy and don't want to deal with using the trackpad. It was also super-easy to download apps from the Google Play store to use on the Chromebook. Plus, it has an HDMI slot on it so I can hook it up to the board in my classroom and project what I'm looking at to the kids. Is it a high-powered computer that suits the needs for graphics-intensive gaming or serious programs? Absolutely not. Is it worth the price for what you get - a cheap, lightweight Chromebook that's great for a teacher to use for lesson planning, grading (in sheets) and composing quick word documents to be emailed to students, parents, and administrators?

,"I really wanted to like this product but in the end had to return it. I did everything to keep it. The product is built with sturdy plastic material that would have fooled me as something else. The display is great under normal\typical conditions. The OS is super fast and you can use google play and Linux etc. Tons of storage about 49 GB available. The hinge felt good. I used it everyday and stop using my now 7 year old windows 10 i3 laptop. What went wrong. Well the screen display was good but it was a little too small at 11.6 inches. The really bad part was the Bluetooth issues. When using Chromebook in laptop mode i use a Bluetooth capable mouse which often stop working randomly for no apparent reason. The Bluetooth would stop responding and once turned off not work again until you power cycled the system. I tired everything to resolve the issue including powerwashing it which is a hard reset to factory. Nothing resolved it. I called tech support and they scripted me. Asked me to powerwash it and then asked me to send it in for motherboard replacement which had a turn around of 9 business days... That is when i decided it was time to let go and return this Chromebook. I highly recommend Chromebooks just not this one. Maybe spend a little more and get something of higher quality if want to use all features especially Bluetooth.

Update: 06/26/19
It turns out the Bluetooth issue is a conflict with Chrome OS and my Victsing mouse. I now have an Acer r13 and have the same issue. The C330 is nice little multi use Chromebook that is priced nicely. The r13 is bit slower than c330 from my experience so far. The r13 has bigger display and uses micro sd card that doesn't stick out like on the c330. Also the r13 you only get 32 GB as apposed to 64 GB with C330. I give the C330 3.5 stars. Overall r13 is not a major update over C330 for around $80 dollars more.

,"When my four year old (?!) Acer Chromebook was showing its age, I decided to upgrade to a newer model and found the Lenovo model appealing for a number of reasons, including that it had USB-C charging. FINALLY, a charging standard that manufacturers can agree on! And for its performance, I've been pretty content with the C330 - it's nothing to write home about for good or ill, but it's a solid little machine for what I need. And, honestly, I probably put it though more strain than a Chromebook ever should, given how many tabs I keep open. BUT (and there's always a but, isn't there?)...
Lenovo, what the heck is going on with this charger?!
Seriously - the charger for this Chromebook is HUGE, but that's not the problem with it - the problem is it doesn't work reliably! I first noticed it a few months ago - the charger would mysteriously stop working for no apparent reason. Because the display dims automatically when the charging cuts out, it became INCREDIBLY annoying if it was sitting on anything less than 100% stable because it would flicker backlight brightness, so I took to unplugging the USB-C cable when I'm going to be surfing for a little while. Then, the charging became even LESS stable - it began requiring tweaking the cable slightly to get it to charge. Now, it's getting to the point where I have to play the old coat-hanger-antenna trick with the charging cable to get it to charge - tilting and turning the cable and the laptop this way and that just to get it to charge. And no - the problem ISN'T the charging port, as it has no problems with my roommate's USB-C charger, just the one from the box.
For a modern laptop, instability in charging is inexcusable. Hell, even with my first laptop 20 years ago this would be unthinkable. What gives, Lenovo?!"," December 9, 2019",5.0

,"This Chromebook is absolutely great! I was in need of a new computer since Windows 7 is no longer being supported as of Jan 14, 2020. I was looking for something smaller than a desk top so I could move it around the house. I basically wanted it for email, banking, and surfing the web. I'm not into streaming movies, music etc. so I'm sure this Chromebook has a lot more options that I will later explore such as the web cam. What I can tell you about this is that it is super fast. I like the touch screen but the pad is really sensitive and easy to use. The screen is plenty big enough and clear. The keyboard is as easy to use as a desk top. I did not rate this for gaming because I don't use that feature so I have no opinion there. Set up was easy and everything transferred automatically from my Google Account that I already had. You don't have to use Google to set this up from what I was reading you can use another option. Everything is step by step and I had this thing up and running in just minutes.

Great laptop,"I'm a developer who needs their machine to pull a lot of weight. Now, these Chromebooks AREN'T made for this kind of work, so I wouldn't grade it on that. Basically, I just needed this machine to work as a gateway to my remote machines, and for that, this worked perfectly. It's light, quick, and simply get's the job done. If you can keep your work limited to stuff you can do in Chrome (and *some* Android native apps), then this particular machine should be able to get the job done.

With that being said, my machine had issues with Bluetooth that I simply couldn't ignore. Normally, I don't utilize bluetooth very often, but due to the nature of this device and the way I wanted to use it (i.e., highly portable with the 2-in-1 feature), I planned the purchase around it. The Bluetooth was essentially non-functional. After looking into it, I found that basically every Chromebook has issues with bluetooth (so it's not necessarily specific to this device), but despite trying everything I could to get the bluetooth even mildly functional (trying beta builds, updating drivers, experimental Bluteooth software, etc.), nothing worked. Specifically, I could connect to the machine's bluetooth, but after a few minutes, the blueooth would completely cease to work and would only work again after a reboot.

After realizing that I wasn't going to be able to fix this problem, I returned the device. I then bought another 2-in-1 Chromebook that was a little more pricey (I'll try to avoid outright advertising for them, but it was $500 Samsung device, so it cost twice as much). This device is leagues better.

First, the bluetooth actually works. I still see many of the ""quarks"" that every Chromebook has, but I an actually use the Bluetooth with little issue. But, that's not the only improvement. The machine itself is significantly faster, which may not be of much value for most, but certainly improves my experience. The touchscreen is also drastically superior, allowing for active pen use. Again, if the ""touchscreen"" portion of these devices aren't that big a deal, then this might not matter, but after using the active pen, I could never go back to a simple touchscreen. On top of this stuff, the new machine is much lighter and much more comfortable. I've had people comparing it to an iPad when in tablet mode, which was certainly not the case for the C330.

All in all, the C330 is a fine device, but it attempt to be too much of too many things, and doesn't do any of it right. It's cheap, which is a big plus, but not cheap enough. It's a 2-in-1, but isn't very good as a tablet. And it's a Chromebook, but slow and not completely functioning. I'd suggest either going cheaper and finding a Chromebook that isn't a 2-in-1, or spending the extra money to find a proper 2-in-1. This just isn't very good as either."," April 8, 2019",3.0
,"I just got this laptop, I meant it to be used for college work so I signed in with my college email first (becomes the “owner account”). I was disappointed to see that like other comments had said, Google Play Store was nowhere to be found and wouldn’t let me enable it even after fully updating. I had a hunch after reading something about “managed accounts” so I went to “Powerwash” aka reset my whole computer, and I happened to see “managed by collegename.edu” below Google Play settings, and when I signed in with a different account, boom, I automatically had Google Play Store. This laptop is 100% compatible with the Google Play Store, if you are having issues, sign in with a different Google account that has @gmail/yahoo/hotmail on the end and doesn’t have any add-ons like student or edu. Not to say that you cannot still do individual things with your work/school account, you just cannot have the account set as the “owner” account. I’m so glad I figured this out because this is one of the nicest low end chrome books I’ve ever seen. The screen is beautiful quality and so is the keyboard, the touchpad isn’t bad (but it’s not great, a lot of PCs struggle with this so I think it’s a necessary sacrifice when it is so cheap, but just letting everyone know, the touchpad does stutter and isn’t completely smooth). I think this is a steal for the price so don’t be led astray to think that this doesn’t work with Google Play, it does!"," August 22, 2019",3.0
"It's a fine machine, but not worth the price.","However, from the get go, it froze and crashed on a consistent basis.
Now it is true that with the super mere seconds Start Up, I was able to go right back to where I was,
but after awhile, the constant interruptions, got old. This was a new Chromebook C330 !!
i noticed that when I tried to Copy & Paste, the Chromebook often ignored my commands. ( Ctrl+ C or Ctrl+v).
Forget it trying to do the same with images or photos.
What I did love about the Chromebook C330 was the mere second Start Up, ( what a joy!), loved being able to
fold the screen back for tablet use,-- except when on social media, I noticed I was unable to post comments, so had to go back to laptop mode. The other thing that I really loved was the white color ""Blizzard"" of this chromebook. -- the color is why i bought it, that plus the 2 in 1 features.
So, after debating; "" do I return/not?"", I finally decided to Return. I had high hopes for this Lenovo Chromebook C330."," March 22, 2020",3.0
,"Pros: The Chromebook is snappy and fairly fast. It's a very stylish and light weight device on the go. The Chromebook offers the google play store and touchscreen is handy with apps. The screen quality is great enough to read books clearly for a long period of time.

Ultimately, this is a great Chromebook depending on what you want to do, such as browsing, school, apps, book and audiobook storage.

Cons: The speakers are on the bottom of the Chromebook, where sound can be muffled. This can easily be fixed with headphones and the Chromebook supports Bluetooth. The SD card slot is not big enough, the card hangs out. The Chromebook does not have a grippy feel to it, very slippery. The keyboard may feel cramped to some. Also, the body of this Chromebook is not very durable. I dropped this thing and the body easily dents. I mean, it's a pretty body but not practical for my use for the long term. Also, I rarely use tablet or portrait positions on this tablet because it's so awkward. It's made to be used vertically and it's a bit bulky. But it's great for apps and video.

Overall, I'm happy, but for the price point some things could be better. But, this Chromebook certainly beats a Windows computer I have sitting around at a similar price point ."," March 14, 2019",3.0
Google Play Store Problem SOLVED!,"I'm still using my trusty old Acer C720 and Windows 7 desktop workhorse daily, but needed backup to assure secure online transactions for banking and the like. The Lenovo Chromebook C330 fits that need perfectly. The AUE date on the C330 has been extended to June 2025--presently 5 years into the future--so I've essentially resolved my Win 7 security issues. (I would otherwise have had to ditch a high end PC that runs like a top, but cannot be upgraded to the most recent version of Win 10.)

As for the Lenovo itself, it's a GREAT low-cost replacement for the C720. The screen is bright and clear, it runs for longer on a charge, it runs cooler, and it has a sleek and modern appearance. The touchscreen works well and the keyboard is pleasant to type on. The Lenovo runs videos flawlessly and the built-in speakers are adequate. I can't really comment on gaming capabilities. That most certainly isn't what economy Chromebooks are designed for, though this might be a something to consider with the appearance of Stadia. My own gaming needs are met with a Nintendo Switch.

You can easily find Google's Chromebook ""Auto Update Policy"" online. If secure online transactions are an issue, check it before you buy any Chromebook!"," March 24, 2020",3.0

I knew I needed a replacement before it completely died. This product is great - similar to the one I had, but obviously new and has a lot of life in it. The only issue I've noticed is that it can be a bit slow at times and if it is struggling the whole system will shut off and restart. I've only had it a few days so I need to work on figuring out how to get it to stop that. Otherwise, it's wonderful."," November 14, 2021",3.0
,"I bought this computer through Amazon refurbished in Aug 2019, and am writing a review for it now, almost a year later. Simply put, I love this laptop. I love everything about it. Fantastic, ""snappy"" keyboard, responsive touch screen, great screen resolution, and I can quickly convert it between tablet and laptop. This is my work computer, and it holds up great with record keeping and Zoom appointments . My son uses it for Roblox and Minecraft- works great. He can either use it as a laptop or fold the keyboard back and just use the screen. I've gotten used to Chromebooks by this point, and now tend to prefer them over traditional Windows-based laptops. The interface in a Chrome book is just quicker (and easier), in my opinion. I honestly hadn't realized a year had almost passed since I bought this- it has held up fantastically and still works like new. I've owned a fair number of laptops, and this one is by far my favorite. I have officially converted to Lenovo computers based on my experience with this great laptop.

It's a pretty solid Chromebook with it's cons + pros,"POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARD
Had been a fairly good unit for the kids to game on but suddenly died when an electrical circuit burnt out at about 15 months after purchase. Because of the nature of it being a laptop, of course we let our children use on their laps and lay it on their bed or whatever, but this unit actually had a small flame shoot out of the corner (see picture of soot in hinge area) that could have been a much large accident if it would have been touching something flammable at the moment it happened. My 5 year old was holding it when it happened and yelled at me that a flame and smoke was coming out of the Chromebook! So be careful about how you handle any of these units, everyone always believes that sort of thing will not happen to them, as I believed. And of course this event happened when it was out of it's manufactures warranty.

This unit only has a 12 month warranty from Lenovo and they start that warranty when it was apparently released to Amazon for resale which was about 4 months even before we purchased and received. So if you don't want to worry about replacing after a year of use do yourself a favor and purchase one of the extended warranty options, because we all know alot of these electronics now are not made for long term use."," February 6, 2021",3.0
,"I don’t game but I don’t have any idea what all is needed to game! I do think the size of the chrome book is great and it seems to work well but I’m disappointed that it doesn’t have more USB ports and no HDMI, which I needed! I also really really wanted white!

Disappointed,"I have now purchased 3 of these. The original was purchased last year for a Chromebook course and liked it so much that iI bought two more for my kids. NOTE: they are phased out and there seems to be nothing of similar quality and value coming- snap this up while you can.

This is a Chromebook, so you should understand that you will not be using Windows or Windows apps. If you use Google Suite and other cloud-based apps now, you’ll have no problem with the transition from a Windows or Mac Laptop. Not good for doing serious image editing, video editing, music production or gaming, but for general purposes (web, office apps, entertainment) this thing rocks. My kids and I all use ours to replace school laptops (I am a teacher) with no issues. My daughter is taking hers off to college.

Good keyboard and track pad, touch screen works well and unit can operate as a tablet, A-frame, or laptop mode due to its a 360 hinge. Fast booting. Can be set up for multiple users/Google accounts to keep business and home separate. Good sound. Well- made chassis. Truly nothing like that it for the money. Highly recommended."," May 31, 2020",1.0
,"My wife picked this up for me as a late Father's Day/early birthday gift. I've been using Chromebooks since 2014, and I've always enjoyed them. Since I'm about to deploy to Kuwait, I've been in the market for a tablet. So, my wife thought I'd be a good idea to order this Chromebook for me as it is a 2-in-1 model. And, I'm super thankful that she did. I am really impressed with this device. Although it is a bit heavier than I would want, it does everything that I need it to do and more. Initially, I was a bit bothered by the large bezels on the screen. I figured the company could have definitely made them quite smaller. However, as you can see from the picture above, the bezels are actually the right size for one-handed holding when in tablet mode. The bezels actually prevent accidental touches to the screen, so that is much more useful than I originally thought. For the price, this is a fantastic Chromebook. Battery life is good, the screen is quite responsive, and the programs show up really well on the screen. Also, this Chromebook (as well as many of the newer versions) come installed with the Google play store. So, you have the ability to download many of the apps to your Chromebook that you currently have on your Android device. That is super helpful... and, as an avid reader, the Kindle app looks fantastic on this screen!"," July 30, 2019",1.0
Surprisingly great product at a great price. Act fast.,"I bought this thing (typing on it at the moment) after my Macbook Pro died. It's obviously not a replacement for a real machine, but I needed something to kind of bridge the gap while I saved for a new, fancier product. For the price, I think it's a great choice. I haven't experienced any lag with videos, and my guess is that if you do, it may be because you're asking this little machine to do work above its pay grade.

To echo others, the simplicity of use is pretty clutch -- many have noted how it's up and running minutes after coming out of the box, and that's so true. I didn't sync my apps with it, so I have a little more space on the disc, mostly for a few personal documents. That's all I needed for now. It's also light, looks pretty sleek, and the battery life is AWESOME -- I don't have to charge this thing for DAYS.

To be really clear, though: this is a $250 laptop. The keyboard feels like a $250 laptop. The case smudges like a $250 laptop. The screen resolution is like a $250 laptop. That said, when I compare this to my work laptop (a few-years-old Acer), I'd much rather work on this Lenovo chromebook. If you just need a little buddy to surf the web, fill in basic forms, and watch some youtube while you cook, this will do it for you. Don't expect too much, and you'll be very happy."," February 7, 2019",1.0

It definitely has done me well throughout the years, I have all my notes and papers on google drive and it is enough for me to do quizzes and tests through my school's platform. The only negative I would say is that it handles Zoom poorly. Sometimes CPU usage is too high when I'm taking notes on google doc simultaneously being on Zoom, then the video starts to glitch out. Otherwise, if you're just using it for schoolwork, then it's a great computer."," August 31, 2021",1.0
,"Great inexpensive Chromebook. Fast, nice keyboard and long battery life. Quick and easy to use for internet, google maps, you tube videos and general use, all make this Lenovo an excellent inexpensive laptop. Exactly what was expected by sixty year old guy anyway. The screen does reflect outside light but so do three other laptops. Speakers are under on either side but are quiet fine for general use, bit muffled at times, same as previous Chromebook, not a real issue. Like nearly all small speakers- limited quality and no real volume. Most annoying, in a minor way, is the slim design takes some careful handling to open since the edge is smooth. The angled front lip provides enough for thumbs to push up to open. Three slight issues to an otherwise great small exactly what was desired laptop. The keyboard is fine, doesn't feel cheap or present any issues when writing hours at a time. Recommend this Lenovo, fourth one, others are pc's, for being good quality long lasting inexpensive laptops. Recommended by a local computer guy, this Lenovo is already the favorite. Anger at windows continual changes and endless updates, even windows 10, justifies using Chromebook. That this Lenovo Chromebook is so quick, easy, fast and inexpensive make it near perfect. Even Google docs is so easy to use. Highly recommend this Lenovo for anyone needing a long lasting, quick easy to use inexpensive laptop with a nice keyboard and, yes a touch screen."," July 3, 2019",1.0
You get a little more than you pay for . . . a little,"Let me start off with: This is the second one of these I have had. I had to return the first one I bought, because there was a problem with the sleep and the bluetooth. Sleep, because when I would close the lid, it would just power off the device, rather than putting it in suspension. Bluetooth, because when connected to a bluetooth mouse for anywhere between 5 to 30 minutes, it will bug out and refuse to work again until it's rebooted.

Now, I had thought that the problems might be related, and since it was a hardware issue, the replacement would be free of both problems. However, I was wrong, unfortunately. It seems the bluetooth issue is just what the device does. It's a bit disappointing, as my Moto X Pure Edition (which was the first Moto X made by Motorola after being purchased by Lenovo) had nearly this very same issue with its bluetooth. It makes me draw the conclusion that Lenovo makes poor decisions when they choose who they use for bluetooth radios.

That aside, everything else about this Chromebook is fairly surprising. It's snappy, sounds good, looks good, works well. It's a lot better than it has any right to be at the price point they have it at. I am, again, disappointed that their cost saving measures had them put in a faulty bluetooth radio in them, but I will find a way. I work from this thing, so I can't be without it again, and I am not rollin' in the dough, so beggars and choosers and all that.

If bluetooth isn't a huge need, this is the ticket. If bluetooth is a big deal, you might want to invest in a more expensive chromebook from someone like ASUS, who uses great hardware."," January 23, 2019",1.0

Wrong color,"I hate to leave a one-star review for what might be a great chromebook and I usually don't do this, but I would like to warn US buyers that third party sellers may send you a chromebook with a Canadian keyboard. This might seem like a small issue, but if you are used the the placement of the shift and enter keys on a US keyboard, you'll find yourself constantly hitting the wrong keys for both of these frequently used keys, which is a real hassle. I'll update with my take on the chromebook, which seems perfectly decent (love the display and the white color; seems at least as fast as my old Acer that is about to stop being supported), once I have had time to use it -- and if I am able to continue using it with the awkward key layout.

These only seem to be available through third party sellers at the moment, so you never know what you're going to get. A shame, because I put a lot of research into this chromebook for some of the other features it has (HDMI port, support through 2025, non-micro SD card port), and I really would have liked to be able to find one with a keyboard that doesn't make me have to constantly backspace and/or think twice about what I'm doing.

ETA: One of the reasons I bought this particular model was because it had a HDMI port so I could project the things I’m teaching my kids into the big TV screen. Unfortunately, after hours of troubleshooting, I could not get the computer to mirror sound through the HDMI, and ended up having to return it.

I ordered another one, from a different third party seller. Again I received the Canadian keyboard and again had issues with the HDMI port mirroring image but not sound. There must be something seriously wrong with the hardware or software on these Chromebooks. My husband has had a side job fixing computers for years, so I turned both of them over to him, but even he could not figure out how to fix this issue. I guess I’ll be returning the second one as well. It’s frustrating because there is so much to like about this chromebook and I really wanted to find a way to make it work."," November 29, 2021",1.0
,"Before I share my thoughts on the product I would like to preface with a disclaimer that I am an educator who has used Chromebooks as a tool for teaching and for my own work projects.

I LOVE this Chromebook and feel fortunate to have above a basic understanidng of how Chromebooks work. First, it came with a Lenovo box packaged in an amazon box. No problems opening the packages or initiating start up with the Chromebook. The winter white case is plastic and may require extra care. However, it does NOT look or feel cheap as noted by other customers. Also, because I noted the complaints with regard to speed associated with memory, I did purchase the larger 4 gb RAM and 64 gb memory with a SSD. I really think this is a gamechanger and will be utilizing this Chromebook for online classes and anything else I may need to do online. I have already been able to utilize commonly accessed apps for my cell phone on my Chromebook! No problems with anything thus far. I will update.

Today is 4/16/19 and I am still enjoying my Chromebook. A couple things that have come up with regard to the laptop keyboard: the keys can pop off if snagged. The keys have popped or snapped on easily when I noticed they were gone. It is nice that the keys don't actually break off. I have noticed that some apps still don't work on Chromebooks, however there are extensions to improve access."," January 13, 2019",5.0
My Lenovo c330 chromebook is AMAZING! 4gb RAM and 64 gb,"I love this! It does take some getting use to. I'm old and I'm use to other setups. I like the touchscreen option. I only found two downsides to this, but in all honesty it's no biggy at all. First it does not support screen savers. Yes it ""sleeps"" and screen turns black, but I'm more of an ambience type of person. Second would be great if it had more USB ports. Since I'm old school haha I used my one and only port for a mouse. I know i have other mouse options to consider, but like I said that's my preference no biggy. My daughter uses it to put songs on her mp3 player and uses the USB port as well and has to unplug the mouse. Just minor things to consider if you decide to buy this. (And yes that is absolutly the only way to put mp3s on that type of player.) Other then that its has a sleak appearance and everything loads quick. That's impressive considering the room I have it in is like a WiFi dead zone. I think anyone would love this if you don't plan on doing any hardcore gaming."," February 29, 2020",5.0
,"I'm familiar with Chromebooks, and I bought this as an upgrade/replacement when my old one finally crapped out after many years. Right out of the box, I plugged it in, it recognized my wifi, asked me for my google ID and password, and I was off and running. Pages load quickly. The touch screen works fine. I like the versatility of the configurations - tablet, tent, laptop. It also came with an HDMI port, which I wasn't expecting, but I was glad to see. This is perfect for my Chromebook needs - surfing, emailing, social media. I do have an old PC for my Windows/Office needs, but I rarely turn to it these days. I can't speak for the battery life yet, but I've had it on all morning and it's still at 90% at 2:30 in the afternoon."," July 21, 2021",5.0
Phew its not a piece of crap!,"It is a nice little chromebook, the first one I bought had an issue with the screen but was replaced promptly by Amazon returns. It's great for general web surfing and blogging, you can use Google docs and stuff with it but keep in mind this is not Mac or Windows, it's Chrome's own OS which only loads Chrome apps, so think any Chrome browser extensions are about all you'll be able to install on it. However, people have installed Linux on it and used it for web dev so it is POSSIBLE to do more with them, just not practical. It's tiny and lightweight and I never noticed any issues streaming.

But what I'm really confused about is the fact that a 2 year old computer has actually gone UP in price by about 25% from when it was originally sold... which is the opposite direction electronics go."," October 1, 2020",5.0
,"For the price, this is a great Chromebook. It checks a lot of boxes and I've done my fair share of research.

3. Touchscreen with an IPS display
4. 4 gigs of RAM and 64gig of storage. (rare at this price point)
5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad.
6. ARM processor that is optimized for the Google play store apps and runs much better than the Intel celerons you see in most low-end Chromebooks.

You get a lot for $300. You can't really find those options within that price range. The only thing I wish it had was a FHD display. 1366x768 still looks sharp on an 11.6 in screen but it would be super sharp if it was 1080p. I would highly recommend this Chromebook."," October 23, 2018",5.0

I'd like to compare this to the much more expensive ipad pro when it comes to being a ""PC replacement"" to give you an idea on the usability you can expect when you want to use this as a laptop. You have a full mouse support, a full desktop browser, a file system, a full size HDMI port to display your chromebook on a bigger screen out of the box, it has a USB type A port for legacy peripherals and a USB type C port. When you want to use it as a tablet just flip the keyboard around and use apps from the google play store. The screen is only 720p since it is a budget device at the end of the day but I am giving you an idea on the versatility of using a chromebook as a computer vs an ipad pro which is directly competing with chromebooks as a PC replacement machine.

It's so portable and easy to bring anywhere. It goes from start up, to ready to use in a matter of seconds. The battery life is incredible! Like nothing I have ever seen. I can easily get 10 hours out of it. Using it off and on, for an hour or two at a time, I can get a week or more out of the battery without having to ever charge it.

"For the most part, easy set up. So far, I like it!","This was a very nice purchase for me as a Freshman in university. Everything I need to do on a laptop functions within the browser. Web apps are a thing in case you need certain desktop functionalities in a pinch. But I would like to reiterate: think of this as a lightweight device that runs a very optimized and very fast web browser. And I mean that; the browser on this thing can handle as many tabs as I would ever need at once. The OS itself is also smooth and responsive. This thing boots up in 5 seconds flat which is a miracle compared to windows laptops I have used in the past. Something important to note is that storage on this thing... isn't a thing. Well it is, but without a third party file explorer you are going to be using Drive as your main storage. Which is great because I was able to redeem the 100 GB free two year storage with my Chromebook. I recommend using cloud storage with Chrome OS anyway, as it will keep the operating system running quickly and it's just more convenient once you get used to maining it.

,"I purchased this for my child to do online school, at the start of the pandemic. I wish it would have lasted, it has a nice clear screen with touch capability. The problem is that it just won't charge. It started about 3 months ago, some times it would charge, other times it would not. I kept thinking that my child was forgetting to plug it in, I should have investigated closer. Now it is completely dead, won't charge with the Lenovo charger, or any other USB C type charger. I contacted Lenovo Support, and they wanted the serial number. It took a while to convince them that unless it will boot, I can't obtain the serial number, there is no sticker, and the box is long gone.

Lenovo Support said they will fix it under warrant but that is going to take nearly 2 weeks. It's a $250.00 computer, how can that process be cost effective for Lenovo? So I have to wait 2-3 days for a return label via email, then it will take up to 9 days to repair. Seems to me that Lenovo should send me a new one and I will return them this brick in the same box as the one they sent me. That does not appear to be an option. Now I will have to find another Chromebook for my child to use...I guarantee it won't be a Lenovo.

Edit 9/30 - Lenovo support has yet to resolve this issue. The dead Lenovo Chromebook is sitting right here. I keep calling every few days, keeping notes on the calls on 9/23, 9/26, 9/28, and telling the same story, with a promise that it will be addressed. Today I received an email from Manager in the Consumer Customer Care asking me all the same questions about the machine that I have already provided. His request was for me to turn it on and he will help me find the serial number. Unbelievable."," September 12, 2020",5.0

,"I've been using this for a few months now. There are some definite draw-backs. Certain apps can't be installed on it. HBO Now for example. (work around is to login and watch via the browser). The specs say that it's HD , but there are issues when viewing some shows on Netflix (pixelated videos, making them un-watchable). I'm thinking it has to do with the resolution limits of this device or with the Netflix app. I don't notice the problem with other video streaming apps. I've already had to do one factory reset because it stopped auto-rotating when flipping it into tablet mode. It also tends to disconnect my blue-tooth headphones at random times. I have to go to settings, turn off blue-tooth and power-off my headphones, then turn on blue-tooth and my headphones to get it working again. If I had to do it over again I would spend more money and get a higher quality device."," January 23, 2020",5.0
"Dead after 5 months, will not charge or boot","I've been an enthusiastic chromebook user for many years. I dumped a glass of wine on my 5yr old asus and it was time to update. The Lenovo c330 is a beautiful machine. Fast, great battery life, really loved the 360 hinge. It worked great as a touch screen tablet. Awesome colors and sharp clear images on the screen. I liked my new lenovo so much I bought for my kid as he turned his old asus into a linux/unbutu machine so he could practice coding.
Near the end of the return window my c330 stopped playing video's from any format except youtube. Couldn't even open photos on fb. The fix was a powerwash but it wasn't a permanent fix. So I returned it and got another. That one and another (total of 3) suffered the same failure. Apparently lenovo does not offer help desk support for chromebooks.
My kids c330 works fine. I was ready to get a 4th but they were back ordered and the price had gone up so I selected a different mfg. Except for that failure I would still be loving the c330."," April 8, 2019",5.0
,"I picked up one of these for a song and I have to say its ""Nice"" I just wish the made nice android laptop at this price point.

The screen is not that great, the field of view on it is wide but at an angle it looks awful and really bright. I hate the fact that they went with an SD card reader not a micro SD reader, it would have saved you some space on the board. I would like to have seen expandable M.2 memory slot on the device. Whenever I close the screen on the chromebook it disables the wifi module on the unit and will no longer download items to the chromebook, It wont use the USB slot for ethernet, its USB-C port seems to only be used for charging (it had an issue registering a USB-C harddisk), its also not very light (which doesn't bother me however it would bother someone smaller then me and ALL OF THAT WIEGHT is the case nothing else.

However; its fairly fast for what it is, the wifi antenna is nice and works well, the keys seem responsive (it also doesn't contain an on/off butten as part of the keyboard (looks at apple)), it plays games well and read docs with okay accuracy, it also has a smart charging USB-C port so it will register if its receiving a higher/lower then normal charge and inform you of such which is really cool.

It does not look like the picture,"This is a great little machine. As others have said, once you open it, it boots up in seconds. I'm a heavy google user, so I appreciate that all my daily apps that I hit up are available to me in seconds on this Chromebook. My only complaint is the battery is not as others have stated. I notice that when I use for a few hours, I'll need multiple charges. Even this morning when I woke up the battery said 87%. I popped it into tablet mode, checked my email, 10 minutes later I got a warning about 2% battery left. I may contact the manufacturer just to make sure I did not get a lemon.

,"The supposedly easy setup failed with an obscure and unhelpful error message on the first try. I called Lenovo for assistance, but I was told that they mainly provide only hardware support, but could provide software support for $39, which I declined. I called the Google tech support number Lenovo gave me but just got a recording directing me to their internet support site. On my own, I started the setup a second time from scratch and was successful in getting the Chromebook going

As a number of reviewers have reported, the full-sized SD card sticks far out from the left side port, making the card vulnerable to damage and inconveniently in the way when using as a laptop; why full-size, Lenovo?

The power supply cord has an in-line transformer block, not optimal for laptop use or storage/transportation.

The Chromebook comes with 100 Gig of Google cloud storage free for 1 year, but taking advantage of this offer required some research. Google should have made this perk more obvious and easy to enable on setup."," July 14, 2021",5.0
Pretty much get what you pay for.,"I wanted to upgrade my original Chromebook to something newer, and at the price with the touch screen, 64gb of storage, and other features this seemed like a good deal. And it certainly is!

First, the Mediatek processor is faster and in my opinion runs better than the Celeron and other processors. With 4GB of Ram and 64GB of drive space this has much more than most other Chromebooks in the same price point. Although not full HD (my only complaint) the screen is colorful and vibrant, and the touch screen responsive. Converting from computer to tablet works seamlessly. Whats nice is with the Mediatek processor you can load most (not all) Android apps. Also, at my time of purchase, Google is giving you many offers for FREE like 100gb of Google drive space, among other things. You also have HDMI, SD card, headphone, and USB ports. The power adapter is USB-C as well.

All in all this Chromebook is a great buy at this price. I was very happy with the speed and flawless operation. While it probably won't replace your Windows laptop or MacBook, its still a steal for web surfing, email, and light document and graphic editing. I'm very pleased with this purchase."," February 8, 2019",5.0

,I bought this on Prime Day at a great price. One thing that makes it stand out is that it comes with 4 gigs of Ram and a card for 4 more. The cool thing is that this card can be replaced with one with 8 gigs. That’s pretty special and ensures that I will have enough space for a while to handle the ever larger editions of Windows.

Works for College,"First, it is not a touch screen. Couldn't really tell that from the description. Maybe I didn't read it close enough. Maybe it is just the operating system anymore but when the anti-virus trial expires it just pesters you to death about renewing it. It never goes away!! It also seems to have more updates than other PC's. My biggest complaints though are that if the screen dims when you are running on the battery and then you plug it in, the screen stays dimmed! WTH!?!? Also, my cursor sometimes turns white. Considering most backgrounds are white, it just disappears. Finally the touch pad is either too sensitive or not enough or something. When you're scrolling it will zoom out. Or it will just travel down and you have to move the cursor to the top again.

,"Got this as a replacement for my previous laptop which was less than a year old before it got damaged. I mostly use my computer for audio editing, web surfing and non-strenuous gaming. This one is great for the price - boots up fast, runs programs smoothly, and has a fingerprint scanner for quick log in. Comes with Windows 11 which has been fine so far. The backlight keyboard is really helpful in low light. I only use bluetooth headphones so I haven’t tested the speakers, but connection is fast and consistent. I did have some audio issues while using Audacity but that ironed out after a few weeks. Don’t expect it to handle high end graphics with these specs, but I don’t really care about fantastic performance for my games so it’s not an issue.

,"Overall, I like this laptop but the screen quality is an issue. Can't see white objects clearly if at all. I had to change my mouse settings to get a black pointer. I am not a gamer so if there are any issues there it is of no consequence to me. The same goes for touch screens. Don't like them and I haven't even looked to see if I have one on this laptop. I did get a runaway screen at one point while I was trying to finish a transaction on Amazon. I haven't really tried to figure out why this happened (it was not the mouse) but I don't think it was a security issue since I have my trial McAfee running. Probably a software setting. I haven't decided if I am going to return this laptop and get an Acer at PC Richards for $100 less with the same RAM of memory and less storage though I really don't need 512 GB SSD of storage which is what I am getting on this Lenovo. The Acer has 256. The Lenovo has an AMD processor and the Acer has an Intel processor.

Dentro contiene la laptop, su cargador un folleto, y un muy breve manual (no ayuda mucho).

Del 84 % a un 23% casi siempre con el brillo al máximo duro de 5 pm a 10 pm (5 horas).
La pantalla me parece su punto más débil, se nota verticalmente, no sé explicar cómo, pero debes encontrar un buen ángulo, horizontalmente está bien, y el antireflejos me encantó. No la he probado en exteriores así que se cómo se comporte el brillo. En general me parece bien, aceptable, si llego a cambiar de opinión lo diré.
Las bocinas me gustaron se escuchan a buen volumen y claras, no soy experto en sonido soy un usuario promedio.
La cámara es mala, sinceramente creo que es mala, en entornos sin luz natural (dentro de una casa, un cuarto) sufre muchísimo.
Aún no he probado juegos ni aplicaciones pesadas así que no puedo comentar ese aspecto, aunque dudo que sufra.

,"Why did I buy this?

I was looking for a laptop that I can use for work, travels easy, but can afford me some game time when I am on the road. Budget wasn’t really an issue, but I wanted to make sure I was getting the most value for what I spent. I do not do intensive work applications on it just email, excel, general surfing etc. I am not a competitive gamer, so getting that extra millisecond of response time was not a concern but I wanted something that could handle current games and most games that will come out over the next couple of years.

What I considered / compared it too?

GPU – GTX 1650 – this thing rocks, most comparisons were to the older (but still capable) 1050i and other variations. I wanted the newest I could get for the cost. So this was the bench mark of my search.

Processor – 9th gen i5 – I really wanted to get a 9th gen i7 but, most of the ones that had it only had the 1050 series of graphics card, and as I stated above that’s what I really valued most.
NOTE: Lenovo DOES make a version of this with a gen 9 i7, it is not available (at the time of writing this) on Amazon. It IS available on Lenovo’s website for about $180 more than this unit (on sale for $270 off ATM), but it comes with a smaller SSD. I know its easier to replace an SSD than a GPU (basically impossible on a laptop like this) but between the cost difference and not having to hassle with adding an SSD right when I received it, that’s why I decided against that route.
NOTE: the benchmark testing on a gen 9 i5 vs i7 were very close in most tests, while future proofing your purchase is a good idea, it didn’t look like a big enough difference (4 cores 8 threads on the 5 vs 6 cores 12 threads on the 7) to move me to spend more.
NOTE: This laptop model might be an Amazon exclusive because I could not locate it on the Lenovo web site.

Monitor refresh – 60Hz – this was a tough one for me, there are some laptops that have the 9th gen i7, 16gb ram and the 1650 graphics card with 144Hz monitor (and there is a difference, just watch some youtube videos on it) but that cost difference was about $450. For the games I play (will get to that in a second), the look, and the weight of the product, I just couldn’t pull the trigger on the extra costs.

RAM – 8GB – documents state that you can upgrade the single 8GB stick to 16GB. 16GB DDR4 is about 70 bucks, if I get into a game that is giving me performance issues, I am ok with that upgrade cost.
NOTE: Lenovo says you should use an authorized tech to upgrade your RAM/SSD or you might void the warranty. I am not sure of the legality of that due to the right to self-repair, but I have done enough that it doesn’t concern me, your views/value my differ from mine in this respect.

512gig SSD – I definitely wanted an SSD, boot speeds etc are totally worth it. 512 means I can fit about 6+ of today’s modern games on it comfortably. I am ok with that for now. It does have an extra 2.5” bay for another SSD (I have a 1TB from my old laptop so if I get to the point where I need it, it won’t cost me anything extra, obviously your experience will differ from mine in that additional cost). The extra bay is nice because you do not have to reload the OS etc, you can add the drive and increase your storage easily. The NOTE above on the RAM upgrade applies here too.

The Look – As I mentioned I will be using this for work too, this is as discrete of a “gaming” laptop as I have seen. I did not want flashy lights or gaming brand logos on the cover. I have the power to game; I don’t need or want to flaunt it in my day job interacting with customers.

Keyboard backlight – has 3 settings, off, low, high. I play in a pretty dark room and the low setting was perfect to let me see while not blinding my peripheral vision.

Heat – this is not a loud laptop (fans); I have been gaming on laptops for 10 years an have had my fair share of jet engines. This doesn’t appear to be one of those. It does get warm, but nothing of concern or that would burn to the touch.

Battery life – I haven’t tested it yet completely (will update when I do) but in “economy” mode (not using the 1650 graphics card) it looks to last 5+ hours, the description says 9 hours but I doubt that, still its more than enough for when I can’t plug in. Running with the 1650 turned on and gaming I would get around 2 hours.

Bloat – amazingly it didn’t come with much on it that I had to remove. MacAfee and a Lenovo thing, that’s about it.

What games do I play on it?
No Man’s Sky Beyond – Played on high settings with no issues/lag/clipping at all
WoW – Ultra settings with no issues (obviously its an older games graphics wise)
Overwatch – Ultra Settings with no issues
As I play and test more games ill update this…..
9/29/19 EDIT - Borderlands 3 - 30 FPS on Ultra, dialed back to medium and was more than great for my average gamer needs.
11/30/19 EDIT - Thrown a ton of games at this over the past few months. Basically anything made before 2018 you can run at max with no issues. Most newer games (2019 releases) will run just fine at med/high settings.
12/10/20 EDIT - Cyberpunk 2077 - played on Medium in game settings with no issues at all. prob could have bumped it up a setting.

What about the backlight/bleeding reports?
Ill knock on wood, I have not seen bleeding on the edges for darker games, or I might just not be noticing it. backlight/monitor darkness, again, I have not experienced this, and I hope I don’t. I get that everyone has defects and a % of DOA product. Everyone’s mileage will differ on this I guess."," September 27, 2019",3.0
Couple days in…. so far it has ticked all the boxes for me!,"If you're gonna plunk the better part of $1k on new tech (that you'll have for years to come), it's important to get a total, accurate look at what this laptop is and is not:

I want to address the positives AND the (very few) negatives.

Yeah, it's not a bleeding-edge gaming laptop w/ a hot & heavy RTX card in 'er. But - I've been playing a dozen games ranging from Fallout 4 to GTA 5, to Cyberpunk 2077, & more. CP2077 is the one game that can't be run at ultra/high settings. But, w/ some tuning/tweaks, it'll still run ~60fps on medium. **Note about FHD screen and certain games running @1080p/60Hz/FPS below in the paragraph on the screen**

Lenovo's keyboard are legendary. Clicky-clacky enough yet smooth and buttery. Having a keyboard w/ nearly full-sized key and a 10-key makes all the difference for me personally. Keyboard is beautifully & evenly backlit in blue; and can be set to 'low', 'high', or off.

Touchpad is standard and full clickable. Of note if you like to turn off touch ""Taps"" (I despise tap-to-click...Grrr...), I discovered that Windows 10 has no easy way to disable that ""feature"" in Control Panel. I had to slog through RegEdit to find the correct value and set it to ""0"". Problem solved!

The FHD/1080P screen is gorgeous. Windows 10's default display settings can cause a situation in which some legacy windows within the OS are displayed at a lower resolution, creating blurry text and border lines. This is a known issue across all FHD screens, laptop or desktop, and the fault lies w/ Windows 10, not you & I, or the laptop. Google will produce a simple fix, and somebody has created a small (kilobites) file that will switch your display settings to fix this problem.

Let's talk about the bread-and-butter part of the Lenovo L340: The video card is Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1650; a capable video card, even in the day of the RTX2080 monsters. Will it play every current AAA-title at Ultra settings? No...sadly. But it WILL play every AAA-title currently out as of May 17th, 2021 at reasonably acceptable quality. And the 2-5yr old games (and older, of course) look incredible running on High or Ultra settings.

Playing Fallout 4 on High setting, w/ textures/fade/water/light on Max/Ultra, it runs sustained @60FPS (capped by default, and fine by me in this case) even while exploring & shooting hordes of enemies in the midst of downtown Boston. Most Fallout 4 fans know downtown Boston to be the game's chokepoint; where consoles and older PC GPUs start dropping frames hard, and everything becomes choppy - even sometimes causing the dreaded CTD.

Windows 10 is Windows. After the horrific ess known as Windows 7&8, I switched back to running Linux boxes or Windows 7 (running Classic Shell) for games, & vowed to not.come back until Microsoft got rid of that Metro crap. I want my OS to look and work like an OS...

...Anyway, when I finally was forced to adopt Windows 10 when my last laptop went Tango-Uniform and I bought this Lenovo L340. And I actually, genuinely like it. This is what 7 & 8 should have been. Metro app clicky-touchy nonsense if you OPT for it, or, an OS for those of us who prefer it.

Last, I just want to say that Lenovo as a company has been pretty good to me. I've owned 5 Lenovo laptops in about 10 years. Two for work (I can't recall model #s), one of which is in my work truck currently, and the one before it that died from living full-time w; roasting hot or freezing cold, dusty, humid, smoky, vibrating/shaking and constant daily abuse over a 5-year period.

One my oldest daughter has used almost 4 years now for college. I hear it's holding up well, and I've been spared having to be ""tech support"" for any issues.

My last one died completely after almost 6 years of OUTSTANDING service. I burned two full spindles (200 DVDs worth) and a good chunk of a third making work-related copies and backups. Never, ever made a coaster. That drive was so sweet, I salvaged it. Thousands of hours on and productive. I actually wore a soft spot in the 10-key. Then the FN key stopped responding. Then the touchpad stopped. One day, I went to start working and it refused to turn on at all. Wouldn't run diagnostics, BIOS was unusable. Toast.

So if I get 5 years out of my new L340, I will be a happy man."," May 17, 2021",3.0

,"Before I start my review, I would like to point out that this laptop has a overall review score above 4 stars, and the people who are most likely to leave reviews are the ones who have issues with a product. The only reason I am giving this product a review that is good (I usually only review products if I have something bad to say) is that I feel it is misrepresented by the bad reviews. Only a small portion of the reviews for this computer are negative, and more people who have bad luck will leave reviews than those who have good luck. So consider that before you think that the 20% of reviews that account for this computer not having a 5 star overall score make up probably 5% or less of people who actually had issues with this computer after purchasing it.

Ok, on to my review

This computer is better than any other that I have used or owned before it. Thats not saying much because I got it as an upgrade to a 10 year old macbook. However, some of the reviews complained about the screen not having good color, and I dont really think thats true. Also, there were complaints about the keyboard, which feels really good in my opinion, and about the flimsiness of the plastic that its made of. I understand that a computer with an aluminum shell would be better, but that is expensive and heavy, and the plastic that lenovo used doesn't seem flimsy. Cosmetically, I love the computer, and the screen seems very good quality.

The main reason I wanted this computer was for editing with premeire pro, which I could not even use on my old computer. Premeire runs very well, and I have installed a few games on it as well which I feel might help some people make desicions about whether it is ""beefy"" enough for their gaming needs. I have been running forza horizon 3 with max graphics settings, and the framerate average is around 50 to 60 frames per second, which is better than I expected for a $700 laptop. The other game I have been running, which some people might be less familiar with is the drone racing league simulator. This game, when on max graphics settings, has realistic lighting and amazing amounts of detail, and I have had no issues running it at 60 fps all the time with max graphics (the game is very fast paced so it has a framerate warning if you drop below 60).

I can't give an accurate estimate as to battery life yet, because I've only had it for a few days and haven't tested the battery yet. I would guess that you could probably get 5-6 hours if you are web browsing, and 1-3 hours gaming, depending on how demanding the game is.

I will update my review if I have any issues or anything changes."," December 29, 2019",3.0
It's good but they sent me the wrong one :c,"When looking around for new laptops I wanted something that didn't put me in debt but also had decent specs and a name brand graphics card. I eventually settled on this laptop and after 48 hours of use I am very satisfied with its performance. Granted I can speak for it's longevity just yet but below are my initial impressions after using it working from home and trying out some games.

Pros:
-It's fast. My previous laptop had maybe half the RAM and I really notice a significant performance boost compared to other laptops I've used. The startup time from powering on to actually being able to use is very quick (under 1 min). I've had several programs running at the same time with no noticeable lag.
-Decent gaming laptop. I haven't run anything super intense on this machine as of yet but the few games I have played have performed very well. I was able to run Shadow of Mordor on high settings with no lag at all. When I bench tested the game it was consistently running around 80 fps. Also, It was also incredibly easy to plug in and play with an Xbox one control, no installing drivers or anything.
-Very few ""freeware"" programs. This isn't something I normally think of until I start actually using a new laptop but most PCs are pre-loaded with a bunch of junk programs that slow it down and never get used. This came with barely anything pre-installed which saved me the headache of going through the program list and trying to figure out what isn't essential.

Cons
-Only 2 USB ports. Not a huge deal but if you use an external mouse with this laptop like I do it really only leaves you with 1 functional USB port.
-Paying for a ""gaming"" laptop. This might sound like a weird complaint for what is advertised as a gaming laptop but essentially what you're paying for is the Nvidia Geforce GTX chip. I saw a number of other laptops with very similar specs that were $200 cheaper because it wasn't a ""gaming"" laptop. But still, if your main priority for getting this machine is for a low-end gaming rig it is still a good deal.

Recommendation:
If you are looking for a high-end gaming laptop that can play triple A titles at max specs you may want to get something with more RAM. However, if you are looking for a multi-purpose office PC that can also run games it is fantastic. Overall very satisfied with this purchase. I will try to update this review as time goes on."," April 1, 2020",3.0
,"First off, performance on this laptop is great. The i5-9300h will pretty much be able to do anything except for the heaviest tasks, while the GTX 1650 can handle a large variety of games, though the most graphics intense games will need medium to low settings. While there are only 8 GB of RAM, in my usage (internet browsing, college work, occasional gaming) that has never been a problem. Again, this isn't the absolute most powerful laptop, but it is probably far above average in performance. Battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, especially if you undervolt (which I did by -125 mV if you're interested), and it runs relatively cool as well, rarely going over 80 C.

I personally really like the minimalist design, with blue accents instead of the ""gamer"" red, so this won't turn too many heads in a professional meeting. The screen bezels are relatively small too, and while apparently the color gamut is not the best, that either doesn't matter or isn't even apparent to me (in case you saw reviews criticizing this). Maybe if you're in graphic design, this might matter, though. The hinge is strong, and can bend all the way to 180 degrees. It's not a touchscreen laptop, but there are some uses, such as watching a video in bed or something. The system is also really slim for a gaming laptop, and easy to carry around, which is an excellent design choice.

The build quality isn't the best, being mostly plastic, but it is still smooth to feel, so there is at least that. The keyboard isn't very clicky, and the travel distance is a little small. It takes a while to get used to, but eventually you may get used to it. The backlit keyboard is nice, though. The trackpad unfortunately uses garbage Synaptics drivers. I played around with the registry a bit to add a couple gestures, but coming from Windows Precision, the trackpad is definitely a massive downgrade from Precision for me. I tried installing Precision drivers, and they worked (excellently, I might add) temporarily, because I guess Windows update has something in place to really latch you on to Synaptics drivers.

Although there are definitely some sacrifices made (including some that I haven't mentioned, such as needing to buy a separate cable if you want to add a hard drive or having only one slot for RAM), I think that on balance this laptop provides fantastic value for $680. In some areas you get what you pay for, but for $680 this laptop can do a lot more than others."," November 25, 2019",3.0
great,"Let's start with the basics. It's a nice looking laptop. It's a modest looking laptop without much of an obnoxious ""gamer"" look to it. The build quality on it feels nice and the keyboard is good. It also comes with a little privacy shutter for the camera. The touchpad on it has some issues, which I'll get to later.

I initially bought this laptop for its specs. The i5-9300H that it comes with does quite nicely with a lot of the stuff I work with, especially emulation. It also comes with a GTX 1650, which pairs well. Unfortunately, it only comes with 8GBs of RAM. It only has one RAM slot, which makes upgrade options limited and preventing dual channeling; I only know this from word of mouth, and I can't verify it myself as I don't want to void my warranty by opening my laptop.

Now, onto some minor nitpicks. The screen is a bit dark, although it's not too much of an issue for me. The sound quality on the speakers are decent, but not that great. The battery life is also okay; it gets about five hours with casual usage, and a little under an hour with gaming. The performance on this laptop is also reduced when on battery, so you might as well keep it plugged in when gaming. The F1-F12 buttons have some functions assigned to them (adjusting volume, brightness, etc.), which get in the way sometimes. It's annoying when I try to press Alt-F4 to close a window only to have it mute the microphone instead. Luckily, this can adjusted in the BIOS so that you have to hold the FN button to use these functions (which should've been the default setting in the first place).

Now, onto the biggest issue. The touchpad is absolutely horrible. It's hard to describe, but the momentum on it doesn't feel right. When I try to transition from moving slowly to quickly, the mouse doesn't follow my finger quite right; it's hard to move precisely because of this. I do have a USB mouse on hand, but I honestly prefer to use touchpads, which is why this is such a nuisance for me. It's not even a hardware issue either; it comes from the lack of implementation of Windows's precision touchpad drivers. Lenovo could've issued a simple software update to fix this, but they refuse to do so. If they do fix it, I'd be perfectly willing to up this to a four star review. Bottom line, get a USB mouse if you're going to buy this laptop.

Now, while we're on the subject of purchasing, I believe the original price point for this laptop is somewhere among the lines of $800-900. The specs are great, but I can't recommend it at that price because the design cuts too many corners on a lot of the peripherals (especially the touchpad). It seems like Amazon is selling them for a little under $700, which I suppose is a much more reasonable price."," December 24, 2019",3.0
,"Let me start by saying I have always been an AMD supporter.
I was in doubt and buying this i5 based laptop instead of the Ryzen 5 from other manufacturers broke my heart.

I made a big research on this i5 vs R5 and found out that the i5 leads the way in 90% of the comparisons.

My choice was purely based on maximizing the value of my money.

This laptop is robust. It's blazing fast.
The i5 does the job well. Even with 8GB of ram.

The ram and the pci-e ssd are Samsung's components. They are reliable and have an outstanding performance.

I plan on upgrading the ram to 16gb from crucial.

If you think about upgrade, there is only ONE slot for Ram. So you will need to remove the 8gb and place the 16gb.

You can upgrade de 512gb pci-e ssd but I do not recommend since the one is really good.
There is a pretty hidden sata III connector for an SSD so I will buy also from crucial a 2TB ssd.

The battery life is miserable. I cannot expect a lot from a gaming laptop.

The GTX1650 handle everything very well. Nvidia software let's you switch from Gaming drivers to Studio drivers at any time so you can use it for your Adobe suite and return back to your daily gaming activities lol.

BE ADVISED: the video presentation of the product might make you believe that the lid's backside logo and the logo next to the keyboard are retroiluminated, but they are not.

The keyboard is very soft. Nice to type.
I enjoyed the mousepad. I saw complaints about it, but seriously??

Well, just get a mouse. I have mine also.

The screen is big and bright. Everything is very clear.
Windows flows nicely on this machine and I can't regret making this purchase as long as it lasts and I surely can't see this laptop failing.

The only bad thing: McAfee. First thing I uninstalled. Make sure you do the same.

I bought it during Black Friday and paid 549 USD."," December 28, 2019",3.0

,"I've had this laptop for a year and a half. Wifi dropping has always been an issue, case isn't as durable as I expected (I've got a crack across the keyboard just from the weight of my wrists resting on it when I use it on my---wait for it---lap), and now the sound just randomly stops working completely unless I reboot the machine? Can't even get 2 years out of a computer these days, come on!"," March 21, 2023",3.0
Frustrating,"This laptop surprisingly good, quiet, light and reasonably powerful. I didn't test it in much games, All I have tested is Total War Warhammer II and it has stable 50+ FPS on ultra settings. With these specs I think it is a good deal. There is not much more I can say about laptop.

Upgradability:
- Processor is soldered to system board.
- There is only one slot for RAM.
- There is no bracket and cable for additional hard drive and I couldn't find spare on Lenovo Parts Finder.

My huge complaint is about Lenovo Representative who answers questions here on Amazon. Answering questions he said that there is extra slot for additional RAM stick. Here is the link to that answer: https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1QTL71H6BKS5Z/ref=ask_dp_dpmw_al_hza. That is a lie. There is no additional slot for RAM on this board. There is only one slot with 8 Gb stick installed so if you want, like me, upgrade this Laptop to 16 Gb of RAM you need to buy 16Gb stick. I'm very disappointed by this because after I read Q&A section I ordered another 8Gb stick along and now I stuck with 2 extra 8Gb sticks after I upgrade laptops memory.

Also, Lenovo Rep mentioned couple of times that laptop is not user serviceable. I don't know why did he said that. Bottom cover is held by 11 screws and comes off easily, after you slightly pry latches. (2 for each side spaced evenly) and there you have access to RAM, coolers (in case you need to clean them) and SSD. ( By the way there is short version installed, but it is possible to install long SSD stick, as it has screw mounts for different sizes). You can find service manual with diagrams on Lenovo site in support section.

Finally I want to recommend to undervolt your CPU and GPU. BUT ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DOING. IF YOU MESS WITH WRONG SETTING YOU COULD END UP WITH TOASTED CPU OR GPU. I undervolted CPU by -150 mV and end up with constant 3.99 Ghz without any throttling and max temperature of 68 C."," December 6, 2019",3.0
,"This computer is fantastic. I use it for gaming and programming and it generally handles the tasks like a champ. A very elegant design, and I've found that the anti glare screen is far better than I thought and I honestly can't live without it now.

A few mild complaints however that lost it the final star:

The edges are extremely sharp. When resting hands on the key oard the edge quite quickly begins to hurt. It only took me a few days to determine that I needed a keyboard pad. After I got that it was mostly fixed.

The track pad is garbage. Especially for gaming. When playing games half the movements on the track pad weren't even registered. And when they are registered something about it just doesn't feel right. I haven't pinned it down yet however. It might just be very inaccurate. This is another thing that can be fixed easily by buying a wireless mouse.

Third, it is a finger print magnet. This isn't that much of an issue to me, but it may be for others so I'll mention it.

Lastly, there isn't very much room for perifrials. There are only 2 regular USB slots. This may be enough for most people but it definitely wasn't for me, especially because I had to occupy one of the slots constantly with a wireless mouse.

All that asside, I do genuinely love this laptop and am very impressed with the performance. It has a high performance for it's price and it shows. I do not regret the choice I made to buy this computer at all."," February 27, 2020",3.0

Me agrado:
-Precio.
-Rendimiento (Tarjeta gráfica y SSD)
-Teclado retroiluminado en azul.
-Pantalla IPS 1080p.
-Privacidad en cámara y micrófono.
-Modo conservación de batería y carga rápida.
-Diseño discreto y elegante.
-comandos de trackpad.
- el SSD es de los mejores, la laptop se enciende muy rápida y ejecuta muy bien todo.
- tarjeta gráfica coherente para la laptop rinde muy bien en videojuegos actuales.
-Centro de control de Lenovo.
-Garantía de 1 año por parte de Lonovo(hasta ahora no utilizada pero es bueno saber que se tiene ese apoyo).
No me agrada:
- scroll de trackpad no funciona bien en algunos programas o apps windows (creo que es problema de windows) esto es lo que más me desagrada.
- al ser de plástico tiende a ensuciarse bastante.
- el micrófono no es de los mejores y sus modos no funcionan bien (al parecer es un problema habitual de Lenovo lo digo por experiencia de colegas).
- colores de pantalla les falta contraste (si te dedicas a programación web o móvil es un problema).
- el numpad es inútil para mi y hasta molesto ya que uso mucho las teclas direccionales y casi siempre termino confundiendo la tecla de dirección derecha con el 0 que es del mismo tamaño.
-solo 2 puertos usb creo que con 3 habría quedado mejor ya que a veces si se hecha en falta ese puerto extra, esto para mi es lo que menos me desagrada.

,"Lest semester my best friend/love of my life and I were needed to venture across campus in a rainstorm but little did she realize that unfortunately her laptop was still in her backpack. The rain came down on us worse than I've ever seen and when she realized her laptop was hosed... well I'm sure you can imagine that this was not a good day at our house.

To make things worse, at the time we were in a cyber security graduate level computer science course which required us to have high powered laptops for password cracking and DOS attack labs. AND AUW LUAWDY did this machine deliver. We had Kali up and running on this bad boy in no time. I actually borrowed it to do some cracking for a CTF I was taking part in at the time and dang, barely heated up while cooking on all eight threads.

THERE IS JUST ONE THING...

Ubuntu did not play nice on this machine. Funny thing, Kali did just fine but Ubuntu had an issue with the kernels and almost every single install she did on it after swapping the OS seemed to mess things. I did a little bit of detective work on the issue and I've pretty sure that Ideapads don't have as much in common with Thinkpads in the way of coperating with non-Windows setups. Windows was easy to re-install.

I asked my fiancee for a comment and she said: ""Is swag"". We're still working on her English but it's like her fourth language so you can give her a break okay, she is doing her absolute best and English is an incredibly hard language to learn when you didn't grow up speaking a language like German or Australian."," March 24, 2020",3.0
Fantastic (with only mild complaints),"So far it has performed well. The screen’s anti glare works quite well and the colors are vibrant. The keys also have a nice feel and seem very responsive. The only complaints I have is that the mousepad is a bit annoying and doesn’t track incredibly well. A minor inconvenience when doing regular things but it can build up to be fairly annoying. However I also purchased a mouse, as I had planned from the start, and I’m happy with the combination. The only other thing that bothers me is that the backlight can be seen lightly in semicircles around the edges of the screen when on a mostly black image. Nothing big, and you really only can see it when the screen is completely black, or the edges at least and it is faint, but it still harms my piece of mind ever so slightly. With that said it has performed quite well for the gaming I do and the day to day use. I would highly recommend as an portable but powerful gaming laptop that also doesn’t break the bank. It’s the first gaming laptop I’ve bought but I was already very familiar with games and the market so I would very much recommend to that audience. I did a lot of research. This was hands down the best specs, quality, and trustworthy choice I could find for around this price. I’d rather the rating be 4.5 stars but since I can’t I’ll have to settle for 5 because I don’t think 4 is fair. So long as you’d be willing to purchase a mouse and don’t try to simulate the world, I think whoever purchases this laptop will be satisfied."," March 21, 2020",3.0
,"Aesthetically pleasing laptop, a little heavy if you have to transport it often. Great for anything that isn't too taxing on it, I've had countless tabs open without issue.
Biggest issue I've come across is having to choose between either a game or having other tabs open, it can't handle too heavy gameplay +other tabs depending on the game.
Sea of Thieves, Apex, and other graphics heavy shooters can only be played at once. Games like Minecraft leave you a little more lenient use."," July 12, 2022",3.0
La mejor en relación calidad-precio,"This laptop’s overall design is very nice for a lower priced gaming laptop. It doesn’t have that gaming look that the majority of lower priced gaming laptops have, which was what I was looking for. Battery life seems to be average for a gaming laptop; I could literally watch the battery percentage go down. Screen is matte, but the 1080p display is really nice considering I’ve gotten used to 1060 x 768 screens. As for the main part, gaming seems alright. I got mine for $599 which is really good for the gpu and cpu included; a GTX 1650 for this price in a laptop is a really good. The 9th generation i5 is really speedy and good for multitasking. I could have Spotify, Discord, and Chrome in the background while I was playing games. You can definitely hear the fans come on; they sound like my old Xbox 360 while playing GTA 5. This if my first gaming laptop so I can imagine that this is average or quiet for a gaming laptop. Lastly, it definitely feels weighted, it is over 4 lbs and you can feel it in your backpack while walking around campus.

Sound has more body than most computers this size and is more than satisfactory. I LOVE that the track-pad is VERY precise and NOT AT ALL intrusive which I love. The build is very, very sturdy and feels like a PC that I will have for a very long time.

The ""Meh"":
Well yes, I knew it only came with 2 USB ports but come on... give us at least 3!
I find it funny that I don't notice any lag during gaming or processing graphic arts rendering and editing videos but I occasionally do when flipping between screens with the Alt+Tab combination, that's just weird."," February 1, 2020",3.0
,"The laptop boots up and shuts down quickly, performs multiple tasks simultaneously, and can play games. Not bad overall.

So why 3 stars?

Something appears to be wrong with the WiFi adaptor.

I purchased this laptop a few days before a competitive event with cash prizes, for the specific purpose of using it in said competition. This was when the WiFi issue became noticeable. At an unpredictable pattern the latency spikes, the game stops interacting with the host servers, and you can't do anything. The computer is not frozen, you can minimize and run other tasks just fine. The game itself is not frozen, other players are playing just fine on the same servers without issue. It seems to be the onboard WiFi adaptor itself.

So I sent a support case to Amazon. They asked a few questions, concluded I had received a defective product, and gave me a shipping label to exchange it. (Downside: No laptop during competition)

New laptop arrived a few days later and still has the same issue. This leads me to believe it's not a defective product, but more likely a low quality WiFi adaptor onboard causing the issue. I now use the laptop for less time sensitive tasking.

I may end up buying a USB WiFi adaptor later and seeing if that results in better performance. The drawback there is that there are only 2 USB ports on the laptop. I usually use one for my mouse and one for my laptop cooling pad, so I'll have to figure something out there.

If the WiFi issue wasn't an issue this would otherwise be a great laptop for the price."," February 21, 2020",3.0
,"I use this laptop for moderate gaming, school work, and occasional video and sound editing. While this laptop is very capable of running most games at 1080p and sweeping the room in terms of school work or general purpose use, video and audio production leaves much to be desired. I can't really argue because the laptop was not intended for any content creation type work and for the price, it's a great deal. The simple and tasteful design is a very nice touch, too. Not too ""gamer"", but not cheap looking and feeling. The brushed finish on the top makes it look like something I'd take to a company meeting without the flashy ""gamer"" trademarks. The only two things that I do not like about this laptop is its track pad and poor battery life. (I use an external mouse and have the laptop plugged in almost all the time anyway, so it's no big deal for me)

An Overall Great Laptop,"First SSD experience. Amazing! Boots up in about 15 seconds. Can have Overwatch loaded up in under 60 seconds.
Plays Overwatch on Ultra settings well for short-periods of time.
Plays Overwatch on Medium settings well for more extended gaming sessions.

Given the friendlier price of the laptop, I wasn't expecting a flawless graphics experience. I'm okay with that, so long as it can still run games smoothly with reduced settings. This laptop achieves that, so that's a win to me.

$750 was my budget for finding a new laptop, and this one was on sale at the time, down from $900+. I'm pretty stoked about having a sleek laptop like this that fit my budget!

,"Edit:
Buyers please beware, I have still been figuring out issues with this laptop 7mo later and recently found out the SSD was replaced by seller and is no longer under the Lenovo warranty and is suspect to my issues. This laptop may cost me an additional $134 on top of the 6mo i have been unable to use it. Beware of products potentially containing 3rd party hardware.

I would say this laptop is pretty good. It can run some pretty quality games with ease (ori and the blind forest, modded minecraft, warframe, ect). The battery is pretty bad unless you put it on reduced mode but its a gaming laptop, what can ya expect? The screen is mostly crisp but the brightness toggle is a bit annoying awkward since its either too bright or not bright enough and there's not a whole lot of customization for display from what I've seen. Haven't tried the touch screen.

My issue, and reason why I've given this 3 stars is because i've had so many unresolved issues and runarounds with this laptop. First with FedEx damaging the first one and the second one having errors about a month and a half later. The techs are always very nice, but I've taken it in and sent it in about 3 times without success and had to explain the issue dozens of times and been told to update, factory reset and hold the power button numerous times.

Unresolved Errors but a good laptop.,"The Lenovo Ideapad L340 Gaming Laptop with 15.6 Inch FHD display looks amazing. Fast Intel Core i5-9300H Processor has proven worthy on opening up and running applications fast. The 512GB Nvme SSD makes this laptop boot up quick and load games/apps much faster than conventional HDD drives. The built-in NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 has been able to handle very well with many new game titles and some VR games. The 8GB DDR4 RAM handles well for the most part.

The HDMI input works great for connecting a larger screen and getting a better picture.

The laptop vents hot air towards the front and can get a little loud depending on graphic settings. The blue LED backlit keyboard is nice to have. I have not had any issues with it yet as I keep video drivers and windows up to date.

This does not have a CD-ROM so you will have to get an external one.

Only option is to send the unit to the repair facility which has the potential to be a three week ordeal. Plus, one way shipping is not included in the warranty. Would love to update the BIOS to see if that fixes the issue, but you need 30% battery life..we are stuck at 3%. Ordered a replacement factory battery from a third party seller to see if it fixes the issue. Overall, happy with the machine except for the warranty part, but that could change if this doesn't work.

"Great for gaming, and General use!","I ordered this laptop for my nephew in late 2019. Within a month the charging port broke and the laptop wouldn't charge. Holding the cord in certain positions would allow it to charge, but doing this broke the port further and required the wire to be held in more and more extreme positions. Eventually the charging port did not work at all.

Since it was still within the return window for Amazon, I got it replaced with a new one. Within 6 months the charging port of the new one also broke, so I sent it to Lenovo for repairs and got it back a month later good as new. And by good as new, I mean that within 6 months the charging port broke again. It is no longer in warranty with Lenovo and so I would have to pay for repairs out of pocket from now on, and with how often it breaks it frankly doesn't seem to be worth it.

,"Edit: Less than a year after purchase, the motherboard and power supply shorted and caught on fire during regular use while plugged in. According to Lenovo support this is a known issue.

Original review below:

Though this is a ""gaming"" laptop, I bought it for work as a developer. The large amount of RAM and relatively powerful mobile processor allow me to run multiple docker instances or virtual machines without slowing down my work.

Given the specs, the battery life is expectedly low - but honestly fairly decent for what you get. If you're not doing anything intensive it can easily last 3-4 hours.

Linux compatibility is great as well - The hardware is all supported by current open source drivers as well - save for the dual head mode on the GPU, you will need to install the proprietary nvidia-driver-430 or newer if you'd like to use a secondary display along with the built in panel.

My only major complaint is that the USB-C connection does NOT support HDMI over USB. It's only a Gen 1 USB 3.1 controller and outputs just 5Gbit/s - far short of what's needed to drive a monitor or two. The built-in HDMI connection works just fine, but I'd have preferred the ability to use an all-in-one dock so it's a bit disappointing for a newer generation laptop to have such an old USB controller.

Best PC for the price by far,"This laptop has very nice specs for the price however there are things that bothered me. The first being the trackpad and the second being the image quality. The trackpad does not use windows precision which is far superior to what is being offered here. Regarding image quality, the colors feel very washed out and regardless of how hard I tried I was unable to replicate the image quality of my pc monitor and previous laptop. In addition to this, the laptop I received has an issue with the backlight showing through the top of the screen which is very unappealing. Aside from these stumbles, the laptop does an excellent job running music programs such as Digital Performer, Finale, and so on which is very nice, but again the track pad and the image quality really both me with this product.,"," September 20, 2019",5.0
,"The performance was great at first! I had no issues with this device. Then I started to encounter problems. The battery drains itself very easily after two months, and I can't even get a couple of hours of just basic web browsing in without having to plug it in. I have reinstalled Windows, and let me just say, the performance didn't change. I installed even fewer programs and games this time, and it only gave it about a 2% performance boost. I am very dissatisfied with how little time it took for this product to degrade. Even my $200 HP laptop didn't lose much performance over the course of time, and I've had that since 2017. I purchased this a few months ago. Can't play a simple Minecraft Java edition game on regular settings, or play Fortnite on medium without constant FPS drops. On AC power. I would have given it one star for the battery, but I do realize that gaming laptops' batteries aren't as good as normal ones, hence the extra star. Also, the 1080p screen is decent, but I only gave it 4 because it will randomly glitch out if there hasn't been an update to what is on the screen for about a minute. The USB sometimes malfunctions too, along with the HDMI Port. Ethernet, charging port, and USB C are all fine. Will continue to use it because I have to, but still, not a good product for what you pay. Beware!"," September 17, 2020",5.0

Great on a budget,"I've given up trying to get the trackpad to work in a way I like. It seems this model comes with a certain trackpad driver that doesn't allow any customization. As a result, the handling of the trackpad can't be fine-tuned to my liking. I also haven't found a way to disable the tap-to-click.

I wanted a fairly cheap laptop to be able to do things on-the-run, which the laptop is able to do. I've resigned to just dealing with the trackpad behavior. The next time I make a laptop purchase, I'll be doing more research into what drivers it uses.

This is a pretty small issue, but the Lenovo splash on startup is pretty hideous. I'd imagine there's some way to turn it off in the BIOS, but I haven't bothered looking around."," February 1, 2020",5.0

"9 months in, zero issues!","First, I bought this product to use for casual gaming (Blizzard's WOW classic) and looked at the specs and price alone and also saw Lenovo made thinkpad computers too (thinking IBM... fyi I learn later it is not IBM). Again, I learned later that Lenovo is Chinese company and that is all that needs to be said about its quality. Also, look in the news about chinese products with privacy issues.

Second, anticipating there to be cooling problems - due to it being a laptop - I got an external cooling fan and put my graphics settings near the lowest settings. This obviously did not help because my CPU and GPU ended up overheating within five months. The warranty (read the bit about the hard drive... it's great -that's sarcasm) did cover the damage, but I recently found out my camera is broken. At the moment it is not worth me shipping it to Lenovo to repair only the camera. I am anticipating it to overheat again or some other problem to occur.

Lastly, I do not recommend this product and I do not plan on buying anymore Lenovo products (or from Chinese companies, minimizing Chinese products to the best of my ability, and buy from American companies at a minimum). Lessons learned: do not buy solely on specs, do not buy the cheapest product, if you see anything about cooling problems move on to the next product, research the company, and go to a local professional (ask for recommendations AND non-recommendations)."," July 18, 2020",5.0

 TL;DR: UPDATED FROM 3 TO 1 BECAUSE IT STILL SAYS IPS SCREEN IN THE DESCRIPTION, IT'S NOT IPS, ITS TN.

 This is a great computer for a good price. In order to keep the price relatively low for a computer with these technical specifications (e.g., Rayzen 7, 16Gb RAM with a dedicated video memory and a 500GB SSD), the computer has an outdated and cheap display. However, as you can see for my video, yes, the display is limited (as compared to other technologies) but it is not too bad. I don't use my laptop in a situation where I need to position the screen almost flat, at 180 degrees.

,"When I first opened the box, I found that the laptop had a relatively solid build quality. Even for plastic, the solid quality to it doesn't make it feel flimsy or loose to type into. Some minor flex is noticed, but doesn’t make it feel ""hollow"" or cheap either. Two days into continuous usage and some stress tests and I'm contented to how snappy it feels. The i7 model I went may be a little bit of an overkill, but it is more than enough for anything. (The i5 model runs out of stock pretty quick.) For someone who came from a Surface Pro 4 i5 and MBA, the build quality is rather impressive for the years I have owned aluminum-based devices. I have not really experienced any serious issues with gaming either. The Lenovo Vantage app is a great touch and I was able to optimize the usage I have for my computer. Speakers were decently capable, and I was able to tune it out using the Nahimic program. The 120hz display is silky smooth and clear with its anti-glare surface.

Bottlenecks, Recommendations + NOTES:

Upgrading the RAM helps...but is rather necessary. I experienced some lag in some areas when I had a lot of programs opened, including FPS drops when I played games requiring a lot of memory. Task Manager showed consistent 40% or more RAM being used. I strongly advise others to focus on upgrading the RAM to at least 16GB to prevent lagging and some potential crashes in other software. Keep in mind, the RAM it uses for intel (both i5 and i7) model laptops is DDR4, which isn't the best, but a great performer nonetheless..Just unusual that the Ryzen version has a MOBO that uses DDR5. I recommend getting 3200MHz to get most out of the performance you need for the RAM. The ""16GB"" limit stated from the manufacturer is uncertain, the possibility to use 32, or even 64GB of RAM should work.

The storage is decent, however the 512GB may not be enough especially for gaming. So I recommend upgrading the memory. NOTE: It is necessary to use the smaller M.2 (2242) SSD (gen 4 capable) if you don't intend to replace the stock 512GB M.2, as it occupies 2280 M.2 already (for what I know about intel)

The display of this laptop is good. It could definitely be better, but for everyday tasks and gaming it does more than enough for what I need. I don't highly recommend doing art/design related work on it, as the colors aren't going to be impressive for this laptop, they are okay at the best. I recommend getting a separate display for that. Some light bleed may be noticed on a very dark background as well.

Battery life may also be lacking if the user uses extensive graphics in this computer. It is decent for the most part, and could possibly range from the least 2-7 depending on how it is being used and the specification it has. I'm yet to run out of battery since I have kept it charged in most cases. I don't travel that much either.

Note: To mitigate with battery life, I recommend opening the Vantage app to switch the power mode to ""Hybrid-Auto"" mode, so it switches to the integrated graphics when unplugged for lower power usage. Unless you intend to game, you may put it back to Hybrid mode. I also recommend switching the thermal mode to ""quiet"" mode, so it reduces performance that may hinder battery life. The hotkey Fn-Q can switch power modes seamlessly. Which is indicated by the power button LED.

I highly recommend updating all drivers as well.

I bought this laptop in mind to use it long term and for moderate tasks and not solely for its gaming purposes. Overall, it is value for price, definitely needs upgrades though."," February 23, 2023",5.0
"Great Laptop. Things to note, especially for intel users.","I'm rating this laptop based on it's specs, not compared to all available specs. With that said, I'll keep it simple. For what it is, it's great. I bought it for a family member that doesn't play the most up to date games so it'll definitely handle anything they need where the graphics card is concerned.

There are two things however. The RAM is still low. 8gb just isn't that much. A lot of games suggest 16 but even outside of gaming, open enough Chrome, Firefox, etc tabs and you'll use up 8 pretty quick. The good news is another 8gb stick is about 20 bucks.

Storage is also rather small by today's standards. 512gb. Half of that was used up within a couple hours between the operating system (windows 11) and the first couple games. This is where things get pricier. A half decent NVME SSD will average around 80-100 dollars per terabyte (1024gb). Faster ones may cost a little more depending on the brand.

So long as you know what you're buying, it's good. I highly suggest adding RAM for $20. As for more SSD space, it's questionable. If you're patient, you could easily get a decent sized external drive to swap programs on for a lot less than another NVME but, don't expect it to be near as fast.

This computer is fairly sleek. Boots fast. Runs kind of loud but not in a concerning way. The battery life is decent. For the price you'll have a hard time finding much better if you're looking at a laptop purely gaming related (that is, at this time given that prices drop fast)."," March 5, 2023",5.0

I recommend upgrading the RAM since the default RAM is not enough (at least for gaming and multitasking). In my case I added 32 GB of RAM to it and it works perfectly fine, so if you are wondering if it can accept this amount of RAM, the answer is yes. The battery is not very good but I will have it charging most of the time so it is not a big problem for me. On the other hand, Amazon support is terribly bad.

Needs memory,"I ordered this for a compact, cost-effective product. I got it and then later that night after I picked it up to move it, I heard something was loose inside. I shook it a couple of times to make sure I wasn't imagining it.

Sure enough, there was something inside the main body that was loose. It almost sounded like a rounded object. I didn't think it was going to be a big problem, until I tried connecting to my Home WiFi. It refused to do anything aside from giving me the ""Connected, No Internet"" error message. What is mind-boggling and infuriating is that it can connect to other networks (like an internet cafe), and my phone and other devices can connect to the home WiFi. But not this laptop for some reason.

I did all of the troubleshooting, and it still won't fix the problem.

Didn't get to do much gaming as a result, or experience what this laptop can offer. One star review for now until I can get a new one.

*1 Si quieres sacarle el mejor rendimiento al equipo si o si es necesario aumentar la memoria RAM ya que hay cuello de botella, al trabajar con multiples programas el procesador y la grafica van sobradisimos, pero la RAM de 8GB y trbajando a mas del 90% y te da tirones, lo mano de esto es que pierdes la garantia*2, se puede agregar RAMM y otro SSD (NVME PCIE 3.0 2280) pero debes acudir acudir a un centro autorizado por Lenovo, el cual te cobrara 700mxn aprox por colocarle los componentes (Parte adquirirlos con ellos o bien en otro lado, pero si es el caso no te dan garantia por su instalacion, pero tu equipo si continua con garantia vigente ante lenovo), mas el envio del equipo o bien pagar por que vayan a tu domicio, lo cual se me hace algo costoso y algo que podrias hacer tu mismo, pero si quieres mantener tu garantia es importante tenerlo en cuenta.

*2 Por ser un equipo de estados unidos la garantia no es valida en mexico asi que el punto anterior da lo mismo, amenos que contrates una garantia extendida en lenovo por precios muy accesibles, al momento de adquirir alguna extencion en mexico en automatico el servicio de garantia se hace vigente en tu pais, en mi caso adquiri el soporte a domicilio y por reparacion de daños acciodentales por algo asi de 900mxn utilziando el cupon que venia con la laptop.

En general es un buen equipo y tu funcionara para trabajo, escuela y gamming, eso si para sacarle aprtido es indispensable aumentar la RAM, en cuanto a la bateria dura bastante poco, uso con rendimiento normal a 120hz durara a lo mucho 3 horas, ya que si reduces el brillo, bajas el consumo a equilibrado o ahorrador y la pantalla a 60hz adicional de no usar videojuegos o programas como autocad, sin problemas te da 6 horas de autonomia.

,"Esta laptop me encantó por su perfil discreto, está destinada a gaming, pero no lo aparenta a primera vista, y es justamente lo que esperaba, corre prácticamente cualquier juego que le pongas, cierto que los ventiladores trabajan a tope con juegos de muchos requerimientos, pero ayuda colocarla en una base elevada y ventilada, la ventilación que tiene es suficiente para que la carcasa no se ponga a mucha temperatura mientras juegas. Otro detalle a considerar es la batería, con uso normal sin jugar o exigirle mucho procesamiento dura aproximadamente 2 horas, lo que es suficiente para muchas tareas, sin embargo una vez que arrancas un juego o le pides algo exigente el tiempo de batería se reduce enormemente, y esto es totalmente esperable, considerando las capacidades gráficas y de procesamiento, además de su doble ventilador lo recomendable siempre será utilizarla conectada.

,"Whatever you do, do not purchase a Lenovo product. I purchased a Lenovo Legion y740 gaming laptop over Black Friday of 2019. I had originally ordered from another manufacturer but they had advised that they would take 6 weeks to ship so I cancelled and purchased the Legion.

I didn't start using it until June of 2020 when I finally decided to purchase a new antivirus software. I refused to use it until I had something on it and my old laptop was still working so there was no rush. Additionally, I don't use my computer for gaming, I use it mainly for things that I think require additional security, banking, 401k mgmt, online shopping and paying bills.

If I used this computer more than 30 times between June of 2020 and Monday February 1st 2021, I would honestly be surprised. On Monday February 1st 2021 I turned on the laptop and it started to boot up and then the screen went black. I thought it might have been a low battery as I hadn't used it in a while so I plugged it in to let the battery charge. Once the battery indicator above the port for the battery charger indicated that it was charged, I tried to turn it on again. The screen remained black.

I was at work so I googled the issue and it appears to be a common issue along the entire Lenovo lineup. I called the warranty support line and provided my serial number. Customer service was in another country and they said it was impossible to speak with someone state side. (Speaking with someone in the US was easy enough when I was purchasing the laptop over the phone though.) They told me that my warranty ran out in December of 2020. They tried to help me troubleshoot the issue but there was nothing to be done. They then reiterated that I was out of warranty and that there was nothing that they could do.

If this was a $400 laptop, I wouldn't be upset, but I paid close to $1,600 with tax for this PC and used it less than 30 times until it broke. Now I have to take it somewhere to have it fixed and spend between $100 and $400 for the repair based on what I have seen online.

You would think that an American company (IBM) would take better care of their customers. But this is no longer an American company. Lenovo is now Chinese owned and it appears that they could give a crap less about building a quality product or taking care of their customers.

If you are in the market for a laptop, look elsewhere to other manufacturers, avoid Lenovo at all costs or it will cost you in the future. Google ""Lenovo black screen"" there are plenty of threads regarding this."," February 3, 2021",1.0

They said they'd take a look; if it's hardware, they'd repair, but if it's the OS, it's on me! Unacceptable. I'll await their diagnosis and return the machine instead of paying for repairing it new out of the box.

Hey, any computer can go wrong, even a brand-new one. But they should have just shipped me a new one and a return label for the old one. I am extremely unimpressed that they dumped this on me.

Update:

The seller (not Lenovo) noticed a bad batch of laptops in this model and unilaterally reached out to me. By then I'd taken it to the local shop for diagnosis. The seller shipped me a new computer and e-mailed me a shipping label for the old one. I dropped it off at Fedex Kinko's, the same day the new one arrived. (The problem was a bad imaging of the SSD.)

,"Tl;dr: I love this laptop and wholeheartedly recommend it.

I have had this laptop for 2.5 weeks now and I have really been enjoying it. The aluminum body is a bit weird for a ThinkPad, I am used to the usual black, but it feels extremely premium. Added bonus, it basically doesn't pick up fingerprints. Lenovo did remove the retractable keyboard with the 4th generation Yoga, but a perk of that is a much better and quieter keyboard. Lenovo has the best laptop keyboards. I think the Trackpoint is a little lower too, but I adapted to it quickly enough. The integrated stylus is a great feature. I have used several 2 in 1's, but this is the first one I have owned. I'm still mostly using it in laptop mode, but when I remember that I can do tablet/tent modes it's always a pleasant surprise.

In reference to battery life, if I put Windows 10 in battery saver I can get around 8-10 hours on battery while working (IDEs, VMs, remote desktop, etc). Closer to 10 hours if I am just web browsing in tablet mode on the couch. Really excellent battery life for such a small laptop. Obviously more intensive tasks are going to reduce these numbers. Although I did play Minecraft for three hours with a Bluetooth controller on a recent trip and still had battery left over. The charger is a 65W USB C, this means you can also charge from a battery bank if you need more time away from a wall.

Really outstanding size and weight. it weighs 2.9lbs. My last laptop was a 17"" behemoth that weighed 10lbs and had a charger that weighed about 3lbs. I always feel like my backpack is far too light and I have forgotten my laptop now. I purchased a NiDoo 13"" sleeve and it fits the Yoga like a glove and fits inside my bag rated for a 15.6"" laptop perfectly - keeps it from wiggling around. An added bonus is the sleeve has a handle and a small zippered pocket, so I also have an extremely compact bag if I just want to take my laptop and charger somewhere.

I did experience a hiccup with the warranty length, but Matt at Titan Tek went above and beyond to make it right. They even gave me a refund to reflect a recent price drop, which was totally unexpected and greatly appreciated. Warranty on units sold in the future should be correct.

Anyway, I highly recommend this excellent laptop if you are in the market for one."," October 5, 2019",3.0
Beautiful machine,"This Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga 4th Gen 14"" 2-in-1 is my first laptop/tablet convertible. I like it. It is very slim and not too heavy to use as a tablet. It has a very good, crisp display with colors that are bright and reflect an accurate shade of colors in pictures and digital images I've displayed. The touchscreen has worked well, and the ThinkPad Pen Pro is a nice inclusion. A regular stylus that works, for example, on an iPad, works on the ThinkPad X1 Yoga screen too. The battery charges quickly and for the kind of work I do it lasts to the end of my workday (8 hours plus with both Bluetooth and WI-FI enabled). Overall, I’m very pleased with my purchase."," April 2, 2020",3.0

"Fast, light, everything in one","I have had this for several months now. It is replacing an X220 tablet ThinkPad and a W541.
I love this machine as it has freed me from my desk and allows me to work outside on bright sunny days.
This is a 10 star laptop if all you ever need is a touch pad or touch screen.
But minus 2 stars because Lenovo has depreciated the TrackPoint and Buttons. There is no tactile feel anymore unless you are in perfect touch type position. This follows me around everywhere including my standing drafting table. I am rarely in touch type position.
Touch pads do not work for CAD or 3D Graphics, only a 3 button mouse/trackball or a 3 button TrackPoint. Setting up a mouse or trackball are just not practical in a lot of situations away from my desk.

I tried a top tier Asus laptop with an RTX 2060 GPU but returned it because of productivity loss without a TrackPoint. Of note, the battery on the Asus lasted only about 40 minutes while doing serious 3D rendering on the battery. It is only good for spot render checks on battery and this goes for this X1 Gen 4. I am talking 4K 3D renders. If you do not know whet this is, you will get perfectly fine battery life.

I purchased this with the i7-10501U. This is impressively fast rendering 3D graphics for a machine without a dedicated graphics card. About 20% the speed of my desktop which has an RTX 2060 card. This is a perfect balance between battery life and being able to do spot renders. I always use this unplugged away from my desk so battery life is important. I run the screen at 3/4 brightness indoors at 1080 resolution and is bright enough when I bring my work outside to the park and work in the sunlight. I do have the 500 NIT screen. The battery always indicates 4 to 5 hours in real use but I get way more. This seems to eat lots of power in sleep mode throughout the day or overnight so I just power off or hibernate for any long periods. Boot up is about 20 seconds using the finger print recognition. Awesome!

I have not made made any use of the stylus but it does work OK using Krita. Touch screen response is excellent when reading documents in tablet mode. All my CAD requires precise numerical input and I find that my finger or stylus is always blocking something half the time. The TrackPoint is the most productive feature of any Lenovo product for me."," November 5, 2020",3.0

Have been most impressed with the sound quality. The harmon kardon speaker set up is the best laptop sound I have ever heard and compliments the visual experience from the anti-glare screen.
My only gripe is that the screen cannot be opened as far as most other laptops. Not a deal breaker by any means, it does not come up too often where I wish it could open further.
I do like the on-demand number keyboard integrated into the mouse pad, although I have not been using it as much as I thought I might.

,"Lenovo Computer Review

I’m no IT guru, so this is a total non-techy user review. I’ve owned and used this laptop computer September of 2021, and I love it! It was well past time for an upgrade, and I spent a lot of time looking at laptops, trying to decide what fit my needs and wants best. I narrowed it down to a few from Asus, Dell, Acer, and Lenovo. Even though this is marketed as a gaming laptop, it’s important to note that I am not a computer guru, nor am I a gamer. I don’t own a single game, so I can’t review it from that standpoint. I simply wanted a computer for everyday computing and web surfing, managing my music collection, editing photos, and running my telescopes (astronomy is one of my hobbies.)

For my purposes, this computer is fast! It boots up in just a few seconds. The graphics are great! Being able to change the keyboard backlighting color is a great feature for me. Astronomy is a hobby of mine, so my keyboard lighting is red, since I don’t want bright light sources ruining my dark-adapted night vision when I'm using the laptop with my telescopes at night.

No computer is perfect, and I do have a few minor nit-picks with this one, though there are none that I find unacceptable. First, this computer came with ABSOLUTELY NO DOCUMENTATION! No manual, printed or otherwise. Not even a quick-start guide. No CD with a manual or utilities. All you get in the box is the laptop and the power cord/AC adapter. In spite of the lack of documentation, it was pretty easy for me to power it up and start using it. Next, the AC adapter is very bulky, compared to the ones that come with most other laptops. It’s about 6”x 3”x 1”, it’s heavy for its size, and it’s situated in the middle of the power cord. I will say that the power cord is quite long, which is good. The power cord plugs into the back of the unit, rather than on the side. There’s only one USB port on right side of the computer, and there’s a USB-C port and a headphone jack on the left side. I would have preferred two side USB ports, but there are three more on the back of the unit, along with a HDMI port, another USB-C port, and a LAN connection. There’s plenty of connectability, if you don’t mind most of it being on the back of the unit. The speakers sound like typical laptop speakers, and I think it’s silly to expect much more than that. I use headphones, Bluetooth speakers, or I just Bluetooth my music from the laptop to my home stereo system. Last, the battery doesn’t last long as long as I’d like, but that’s to be expected from a computer with the high-end processing and graphics capability this computer has. For every day, non-gaming use, I get about two-and-a-half to three hours of use from the battery before I need to recharge it. If you need portability power, you’d do well to use all of the power saving settings, have an alternate power supply to plug into, or an extra battery, or consider another computer altogether. Again, none of these are things that cause me any real issues, but they might for others. In spite of them all, I do love this machine!

One of the things about this computer that was a big selling point for me is that it was sold directly by Amazon, rather than a third-party vendor on Amazon. I hear a lot of hard luck stories from folks who bought computers from third-party vendors who had a tough time either getting warranty service for computers with problems, or returning them for refunds. And a lot of computers offered by third-party vendors have been modified by those vendors. I read a lot of reviews from customers of a lot of those units, complaining of inferior parts being used for the mods. Luckily for me, I had no desire to return my computer, nor have I had any functionality issues with it. But when I have had to return anything to Amazon, it’s always been a no-hassle experience for me. And to top it off, the Amazon price on this computer was less than that offered directly from Lenovo.

What I like:
Looks great!
It’s fast! Boots up in only a few seconds.
Graphics are top notch.
WIFI and Bluetooth work well
Keyboard backlighting colors are changeable (red is my preference)
10-key pad on keyboard (I use this a lot!)
Sold directly by Amazon (at least it was when I bought mine)

What I don’t like:
NO documentation
The battery could last longer
Most of the connectivity ports are on the back of the computer
Bulky AC adapter
Annoying occasional sales nags from McAfee and Microsoft. Fairly easily removed."," April 27, 2022",5.0

,"After 12 months of owning this, i can say it was a very nice and solid choice of a laptop for the price i got it for (1000$).

+ The Pros:
- Slick design that doesn't scream gamer.
- The laptop build is solid.
- Keyboard is pleasant to type on.
- Nice and vibrant screen.
- Plays anything i throw at it with ease (@1080p 60fps on god of war. 120+ fps apex legends. 90+ fps monster hunter rise. 200+ fps divinity original sin).
- Runs cool, CPU and GPU doesn't exceed 75c in most demanding games/applications (if you apply the tips below).
- Decent 4.5 hours battery life.

- The Cons:
- The 3050ti is actually great but the 4gb of vram might prevent you from choosing very high textures in games or could be an issue if you try to render super heavy scenes in 3d softwares that require alot of vram. (For me it was enough to run Lumion 3D without issues and it never exceeded 4GB)
- My unit has high pitched fans so it's loud under load.

Tips to reduce your CPU and GPU temperatures on the laptop:
1- Have the back of your laptop raised by few centimeters to allow more air into the vents. (3 to 5c lower temps)
2- Play on balanced mode instead of Performance, you will get lower temps (by up to 10c) and not much performance is lost (5% to 10% at worst, at least that's what i saw with my games.)
3- Disable boost, this had minor impact on my fps but i had cooler temps on my ryzen 5800h temps (14c lower temps).

To disable boost follow steps below:
– Run cmd as administrator and type in:
powercfg -attributes sub_processor perfboostmode -attrib_hide

This will reveal a setting ""Processor performance boost mode"" in the advanced options in your power plan settings that lets you enable or disable boost.

– If you want to Undo the previous operation
powercfg -attributes sub_processor perfboostmode +attrib_hide

– Configure it in your preferred power plan:
Control Panel/Power Options/Change Plan Settings/Change advanced power settings/Processor power management/Processor performance boost mode

While Disabled (Default: Aggressive) your thermals will improve drastically with minimal or zero performance lost depending on the game.
If you don't want to completely disable it use Efficient Aggressive.

Note that disabling boost reduces performance when doing demanding non-gaming workloads like rendering (mostly CPU workloads), so disable it if you want max performance at the cost of more heat.

A great gaming laptop,"The Lenovo Legion 5 with RTX 3050Ti is an amazing gaming laptop for around the $1,000~ price point.

While it is true that the 3050 and 3050Ti are the lowest tier GPUs of the RTX 3000 (mobile) series, for casual gaming this laptop delivers some great performance and graphics, do keep in mind that a lot of recent AAA titles won't play at the highest graphical settings compared to if you were using a higher tier GPU like the 3060, 3070 or 3080, but for the types of games I personally play, the 3050Ti still performs great at an affordable price.

The device itself is very well built, the outside is made of plastic but it feels solid, the keyboard feels nice to type and game on, the trackpad is ok but using a mouse is preferable, speakers aren't amazing but don't sound terrible either, the camera is there and it's whatever but you at least get a switch to physically disable it at any time. The display on this is great, it gets very bright, the refresh rate is of 165z, and the color accuracy is respectable. Thermals haven't been a problem with the games that I've thrown at this device, there are three fans settings to pick from: quiet, balance, and performance, even at performance mode I can barely just hear the fans kick in when a lot is happening on the screen, plus this cooling pad that I got from ""havit"" seems to help it a bit.

Maybe my only two nitpicks (that aren't too big of a deal for me to take stars away from this product), is that the keyboard has a number pad, which is more of a subjective taste but I personally just don't ever use the number pad on any keyboard, and the second nitpick is the fact that out of the box this laptop comes with 512* GB of storage (more like 475 GB considering how much storage system files take up), but on the bright side there is a second SSD slot inside the device so storage can be upgraded in the future.

If you couldn't tell, I am very happy with this laptop so far, especially considering how I went from a laptop with an AMD A12 with integrated Radeon Graphics to a Ryzen 7 5800H with RTX 3050Ti, like, over half of my Steam library has now unlocked and become playable!

,"It is a really good looking laptop, the I/O at the back makes cable management when 'docked' very easy.
It has great performance, especially in multithreaded applications, if you have an extra buck or two rather go for the 3060 variant, for mainly the more vram, that was unfortunately not in my budget. Still I am very happy with the performance.
The screen is absolutely brilliant. It the ufo ghosting test it makes my separate display look like trash. It has vibrant colours, high brightness, the high refresh rate is wonderful.
The keyboard is very nice and the only complaint I have for the trackpad is that is could have been a little bit bigger, however with this type of laptop, one usually uses it with a mouse, but something to keep in mind.
The cooling fans can get quite loud, but is is more of a whoosh sound than a whiny sound, so it is not really irritating, however if you are buying a gaming laptop, you are probably not buying it for being quiet. When doing lighter tasks like web browsing and using office applications, on the auto power setting, it is quiet 90% of the time, it only gets loud when doing heavy tasks, and then it is in performance mode. Quiet mode is always deathly quiet.
The battery is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop, keep in mind this is in quiet mode, using the internal gpu, lower brightness and only web browsing, office and reading PDFs, but I have gotten 5-6 hours out of this machine which is actually what they advertised, which is nice to see, usually the advertised numbers for battery is impossible to obtain, so I am happy to see that it is accurate. I have not checked at what framerate the monitor runs in the lower power mode, but since the only predefined option is 165 I presume it runs at 165, so by creating a lower refresh rate setting manually, it could improve battery life even more.
Speakers are meh, but it is laptop speakers, so I was not expecting anything fancy, if you have money for this just use headphones or earphones if you are doing anything where sound quality is important, or you care about bass."," September 3, 2021",5.0

,"Almost two weeks in with my new Lenovo Legion 5 gaming laptop and so far I'm quite happy with it. Only problems for me were some old outdated cables which caused connection issues that I needed to upgrade to with additional purchases on Amazon. Keep in mind folks, all the USB-A ports on this thing are 3.2 Gen1. You may or may not have problems trying to use older 2.0 cables. This laptop replaces an MSI gaming laptop that was a few years old and was beginning to have problems so I looked around Amazon and found this little affordable gem. Very happy that I purchased it. I like the 512gb SSD drive, very fast to launch programs including Adobe Creative Cloud apps. I'll add an additional 1tb SSD drive in the available slot in the near future but for now everything is humming along nicely. I added two external 27"" monitors, one via the HDMI port and the other with one of the USB-C ports. Both USB-C ports are Alt-Mode supported and are capable of transmitting video signals so you can add additional monitors via these two ports. I don't know if either USB-C ports are capable of using docks though. I'll contact Lenovo customer service to find out. For gaming I only have time to play a few AAA games, Star Wars Battlefront I & II (EA), BioShock games and the Age of Empires games (not the new AOE IV though, I uninstalled it after playing a few hours, I find the graphics terribly disappointing, awful for 2021-22).

Great Laptop,"Ight y'all gonna be straight up... This computer is solid for its price. The build quality feels... Mmm... Just flat out great. Solid, but not too heavy, but it feels heavy ya know?

Battery is OK, little on the shorter side but it has a 3050ti in it and the ryzen 5800h really helps keep it going. Its a ""gaming"" laptop so the 5ish hrs I got with mid screen brightness and multitasking was plenty for me.

The screen BTW, it's beautiful. I'm a huge fan of high quality IPS flicker free (DC dimming) displays and this one is probably one of my favorite screens I've used. I think people seriously underestimate how messed up flickering lights at their brains for many hours a day is. Its best to avoid in all places possible and this laptop supports that.

I have a ryzen 3600 and 1660ti in my main rig and this thing matches it for sure, even outperforms or slightly but haven't had enough time with it to say for sure about all that.

Generally the keyboard is awesome and comfortable to use, the track pad is responsive and thank God they put a dedicated function key to disable it if you don't need it... They have an electronic camera emable/disable switch.

For gaming it's a 3050ti 4gb for my version with a ryzen 5800h, it can run pretty much every major modern game with the exception of super high video memory titles, in which case you lower your settings a bit.

As a workstation (why I got it), beast mode. Things a tank. Sound quality on headphones and speakers are exceptional (reminder it's a laptop), camera is decent (what do you expect on a laptop?), and overall the machine is eating everything I'm throwing at it and handling it quite snappily.

Pros:
- It plays whatever I throw at it like a dream, the RTX chip is godsend, coming from a lower end PC. I'm not used to seeing games on Max with more than 20 frames lol
- The audio is pretty crisp, I use to always use headphones on my old set up, but I don't feel like I need to with this laptop.
- The general look and feel is definitely premium, this thing is built like a tank. Compared to my other gadgets like my iPad, I'm not so paranoid about any drops or bumps. (Ofc I'm still over protective of this thing)
- Beautiful display, I tend to use my laptop over my smart tv when it comes to movies anymore. The LED keyboard also sets the mood which is a huge plus.

Cons:
- My main beef is the storage, I wish it had 1T SSD but for the price with the RTX I couldn't pass this up. I'll definitely need an external HD or have a friend install an SSD down the road.
- While it's dead built like a tank, it also heavy like one too. This isn't fun to carry around, especially being a weak nerd.
- Battery life is practically non existent, not even 30 mins into gaming, I'm having to fish for my charger. I kinda expected that but again it makes the portability kinda sucky.

In conclusion, I feel like the pros definitely out weigh the cons. I've always wanted a Lenovo, and I'm definitely not regretting getting one! I really love this laptop!"," September 20, 2021",5.0
A beast of a laptop for the $$$,I love the gaming laptop for gaming it runs everything so smoothly and it makes me load into games a lot quicker and faster than my other friends. Very pricey but worth it would recommend to others. It had great storage its very good I love it.," March 26, 2023",5.0
,"This laptop is blazing fast. The trackpad is accurate and smooth and, for the most part, does a good job at palm rejection while typing. Together with the high screen refresh rate, scrolling through webpages is very smooth.

I only have three issues with this laptop, and if you're using it for gaming, you won't care about either:

1. The numpad on the keyboard is very tight. Its keys are smaller than those of the rest of the keyboard. Not only does this make the numpad itself close to useless, but it takes space from the rest of the keyboard and moves it to the left.

2. While I like the performance of the trackpad, its placement is downright uncomfortable. As a right-handed person, I get noticeable fatigue in my arm and wrist after 30 minutes of usage or so.

3. The laptop sucks air from underneath it, and the fans are places in a way that, if you place the laptop on your lap, they're both blocked by your legs. Now, you're not going to game with the laptop on your lap so the fans won't work too hard in such a scenario, but it still has me worried about the longevity of the laptop if it's often used on a lap (which I quite like to do). You can use a laptop tray to solve this, of course, but with the significant weight of this laptop, it does feel cumbersome."," August 17, 2021",5.0
Very happy,"I purchased this laptop as I am entering the Civil Engineering field and needed a device that could easily work with Autocad, REVIT, Sketchup and Civil3D with no issues. So far this laptop has handled all those task easily and made my life as a 42 year old returning college student easier. The NVME drive is fast, the screen is good with decent color reproduction and I have had very few issues with the Realtek wifi card, although I will upgrade it as soon as funds allow. The overall build quality is fine, with no creaks, bad hinges or other fitment issues. My only real complaint is the 60wh battery only gives me about 3-4 hours of use with a slightly dimmer than normal screen if I am using Autodesk or Adobe apps away from my desk. I feel a 80wh upgrade is in my future. The touchpad is decent for a Windows laptop, but still far from the Apple touchpads I am used to. Overall I am pleased with my purchase and feel this laptop will get me through school and into my second career with no issues.

NOTE: You can charge this laptop via USB C while it is sleeping or shut off. It will not charge while on and being used. Make sure to use the rear USB C port and the charger is rated for greater than 65w."," October 31, 2021",5.0
,"I first received the laptop back in Oct 2021 but did not open to check as I trust Amazon for all of their products based on all of my previous experiences. Not until recent days, did I decide to open the box and give it a try Initially, everything was fine, then I noticed a broken part on the back of the laptop. I couldn't believe it. I don't know if this is Lenovo's problem or Amazon's problem. And things only got worse from here. Within the first 30 mins of using this laptop, the constant bluescreen told me that an ""unknown problem has occurred. We need to gather some information then you may restart your laptop"". When I say constant, I mean every 5 mins and no, I did not open a crazy amount of software or anything, it was only youtube watching (3 - 4 tabs on chrome) while downloading Genshin Impact from the official website.

After some research online (i should have done this before purchasing), it appears that this is a faulty issue on this laptop and is causing many users unusable. And this problem is unsolvable (even after contacting Lenovo support). So basically I spend 1k on a laptop with a serious flaw.

I am returning this right now and will update my experience here regarding the return status.

My personal suggestion, stay away from this laptop. Find one that doesn't give you an unsolvable bluescreen gaming laptop."," February 1, 2022",5.0
"Great performance, poor ergonomics","I love this laptop. Don't get windows 11. I found this laptop at a microcenter with a much better graphics card 3070 and a better battery life but I couldn't have it on hold as long as I needed to to go and get it. This computers battery is atrocious. Don't use while it's unplugged for a long time. It comes pre loaded with a lot of bloatware. I downloaded a third party application that makes it so that way you can lower the refresh rate to 60htz or your computer dies from full charge in 30 minutes. After making it so I can switch from 165htz -> 60htz the battery life lasts about 3 hours more. Like any other gaming laptop, it gets extremely hot. Oh and back to the refresh rate, this is advertised as 165htz which looks great but if you go to change it in window's settings, you can't change it to anything else. That's why I downloaded that other software. It's upgradable which is why I got it. I put in another ssd, of course you have to partition but it works perfectly. I put more ram in, and it's a beast, but with power distribution (because it's a laptop) the hardware will never be completely utilized to the fullest unless you overclock everything while plugged in.

,"Overall purchasing experience was good, delivered in the expected time frame and perfect condition. Although amazon packaging seemed careless since it was not cushioned, I mean the laptop box was sent inside an amazon box with no shock proof protection as I have gotten with other not so fragile items, however the laptop box was in perfect condition, so the package management was good through the deliver.

The laptop itself is a good trade off between power and price, there is enough CPU power to work on the go and just enough GPU for occasional gaming.

Build feels great and robust despite being plastic. On the weight side is not the lightest of laptops but I guess is the price to pay in terms off cooling and CPU power as other similar laptops as lighter but with lower core processors.

The fast charging is good, I got it full charge from ~40% in around 2 hours. FHD display looks good.

On the bad side, the camera. Grainy image and bad quality overall, I'm not sure if it is a hardware or software issue, but I think Lenovo should improve this even for entry level laptops."," September 13, 2021",5.0
A fantastic laptop for those that want the power of a gaming laptop without all the RGB puke,"The issue with this product is the battery is way too small, it’s capacity could be on most PCs for personal work use be okay. But, for a gaming build it just barely holds up. There’s a reason the PC has a fast charge option, in all reality this is “portable” so long as you can make it to a charging port within less than two hours. I will say it does what it’s meant to do, the issue is the battery tech is just not there. I will say the hardware is good for the price 1299 at which I bought mine, but the downsides of a laptop versus a desktop really do show here. Understandably, battery life in gaming PCs is an issue across the board. I just found this one to be exceptionally low, I even turned off all RGB back lights, lowered brightness, and lowered fan speeds. I did everything you could imagine as well as throwing it in power saver mode—the hardware just sucks power like nothing else. Overall runs games great, but you will constantly be plugged in: no doubt."," December 4, 2021",5.0

Unsolvable bluescreen issue on this gaming laptop & damaged item,It has really good specs and comes with lenevo vantage which shows all details of the laptop and let’s you change things like lighting. It’s battery life isn’t very good though. It last about 5 hours under small loads like doing school work or regular web surfing and then it dies much quicker with the fan on max speed and playing a game or something. I think this laptops only downside is the battery. The screen looks great and can be very bright. It runs very well and the fan can be turned to silent mode which I can only hear when there’s complete silence and I put my ear close to it. Mine came with a 1 year warranty which is always great.," October 3, 2022",5.0

Excellent,"I really had high hopes for this laptop but I found a couple of issues that caused me to return it. First, there was a little bit of backlight bleed on the bottom left side of the screen. While the screen was nice and there was the normal amount of IPS glow, the little white light bleeding through on the bottom left caused me some concern. Although it was not much, it was enough for me to wonder if it would get worse over time. Knowing that there have been some who have complained about screen issues, I did not want to take the chance.

Second, the laptop had a few keys that had tactile issues. The #3, #4, and W were not as responsive and springy as the other keys. When I barely moved my fingers across the number row without applying pressure, I could feel that the #3 and #4 keys seemed to be off a little. It worked when typing but I could tell the difference between them and the other keys. The W key was not as bad but you could still feel the difference between it and the Q, E, A, and S. While they may have never caused any issues throughout the life of the laptop, I don't want to take that risk with a $1000+ laptop. I have seen videos and forum posts about this same model where keys are sticking and/or not responding. I did not want to send it to Lenovo for warranty service since I just bought it. Personally, I don't trust a device that has to receive warranty repairs right out of the box. Hopefully, Lenovo can address these issues because this seems like it could be a very great machine."," October 12, 2021",1.0
,"I installed Ubuntu on it. WiFi card didn't have support previously, but does now.
Other notes:
- The rear USB-C port will not support HDMI over USB, but the side USB-C port will.
- Good battery life, unless you're playing games.
- Great sound. Great display.
- Has webcam hardware switch (don't forget it exists and drive you temporarily insane thinking something is broken ;)
- The keyboard has a great tactile feel, can turn off lighting effects.
- I've only run 7 Days to Die and Valhiem as far as graphically intense games go, but both run well at Medium settings (I don't have many super demanding games and haven't done stress testing by setting the games to max).
- The fan gets annoying when it heats up (as can be expected), but cools off fast when done playing. Pretty good at cooling IMO, and quiet when doing most everything else.
- My machine learning course work ran quite fast on this machine.
- Camera is good, may be better in Windows? Dunno.
- Haven't tested the mic.
- Plastic casing, so don't expect it to feel super sturdy. Not bad though."," January 4, 2022",1.0
Almost,"The laptop is a great choice for people who want a portable gaming experience, though there are a few problems. First, the laptop will get loud/hot very fast on newer games unless you lower the quality a lot. Second, the touchpad is sensitive and you'll find yourself accidently clicking things from time to time. Third, the people who shipped my laptop didn't have a sticker on the package warning about the lithium batteries as well as didn't even put any bubble wrap to keep the laptop safe. Finally, the battery life only last a few hours so you'll have to charge regularly. Other than that, the laptop works great and can play any game I throw at it.

,"This is a nice laptop, runs clean, after first opening it, it stalled a few times, updated it though and everything is fine. Hoping this is good enough to do image editing. One problem I have with it so far is it has this thing called Lenovo Vantage and it is a great program to keep your laptop healthy but it does not show me what it fixed after it supposedly fixed something. I also get this annoying pop up asking me to pay for it and apparently it is free in the Microsoft store. I will have to remove this Vantage and download the free one in the Microsoft store. I do not know why it keeps asking me to pay for it when it states it is completely free.
Only time will tell if this laptop will serve me well or not. I will come back to up date my review if I run into any problems. So far its fine. The price could have been better but the hardware for these laptops are not cheap these days."," August 6, 2021",1.0
I like it and generally works well with Linux/Ubuntu,"What can I say, the laptop is amazing, the screen is 99% RGB, the CPU Ryzen R7 5800h is a monster, the rtx 3050ti with just 4gb of vram is a horrible thing, but still you can't even build a desktop more powerful than this thing for $999, I added 16gb extra ram to a total of 24gb and also a 1tb SSD to a total of 1.5tb SSD this laptop is great for games like red dead redemption 2, GTA v, Doom eternal, but the best thing for me is video editing, it's like 3x faster than my i7 7700k, but this thing is a laptop! You can manually set the tdp limits to make it run really cool and silent when you need it, or Max fans and Max power when you just want UNLIMITED POWAAAAA! 8 cores 16 threads @4.4ghz on a laptop was beyond dreaming just 3 years ago, I really love AMD, the rtx is severely castrated with those 4gb vram but still with dlss and fsr I'm sure it will handle anything for at least 5 years to come"," September 18, 2021",1.0
,"I'm impressed at how good this laptop is. The only downside is the battery life and the HUGE charger, it's rather heavy too.

I've been using this laptop for work (I do 2D animation) and some casual gaming and it runs smoothly. The fans are VERY loud when gaming, but that doesn't bother me as long as they keep the laptop from becoming a roaster (they do)

I upgraded from my last laptop, an HP pavilion gaming 15. The hinge on this old laptop just popped out of the case one day and I was very careful with the screen, turns out it was an HP design flaw. SO I made lots of research on this Lenovo's legion 5 hinge system and it is very solid and the screen feels pretty solid whenever closing and opening the lid.

Overall, it is a great budget laptop, works perfectly for design programs (adobe suite, 3d and 2S animation software) and runs games very smoothly (just use a good headset so you don't hear the fans doing their job)"," October 23, 2021",1.0
Great Laptop With A few Problems,"I'm not sure about the gaming aspect of this lap top and personally, I don't care. I bought this lap top for the purpose of running programs like Solid Works or Fusion 360 for drawing and designing parts for machining purposes. This lap top does exactly that.
This lap top is exceptionally fast and does exactly what I need it to do. I do not game at all.
My only complaint is the batter life. The battery life sucks ass. Within about 2 hours the battery is at 40-50%. For me that's not that big of a deal as I always have my power supply with me. I just feel this battery life should be a lot more efficient than what it is.

Nice Laptop,"I don't like leaving poor reviews and my experience may be unique. I was excited about this laptop based upon all of the positive reviews. However, from week one there have been nothing but problems. Driver issues, blue screens, overheating, fans running non stop and system shutdowns.

I initially tried to resolve the issues with lenovo support over the phone. System restores, bios updates, driver updates (which it turns out there are known issues with the NVIDIA drivers and some Legion machines according to the Lenovo reps. NVIDIA is supposed to have an updated release in early February I was told).

Lenovo finally sent a tech on site to replace the heat sync, which was great but did not resolve the issues. The tech suggested a motherboard replacement if this didn't fix the issue. I called support again and was told since a tech came on site once, I would have to ship the machine to their depot. Shipped the machine to their depot and included videos and detailed description of what was happening. They simply restored the OS and shipped it back to me. Worked for about 3 days and then started the same process. Called support again and shipped it back to the depot a second time where they replaced the daughterboard and shipped it back to me. First time I tried to boot the machine the fans were going crazy and machine would not boot.

Bottome line - I have been going back and forth with Lenovo support for well over two months now. We have had a tech come to our house and sent the laptop to Lenovo twice and I have spent over 15 hours on the telephone with Lenovo and Amazon Support. The status was finally escalated to the highest level and I was told I would receive a call within 7-10 business days. It was 15 business days before I received a call and was told by the rep I would receive an e-mail and a tech would be scheduled within 24 hours. That was four days ago and I still have not heard from Lenovo. I left a message with the rep after two days to do my due diligence.

I finally contacted Amazon for the third time to see if there was anything they could do as they had punted to Lenovo Support twice already. Since it was past the 30 day return window they offered me an 80% refund, which I decided to accept.

I was able to use the machine for less than 3 weeks of the 4 months it's been in my possession and I ended up losing $250.

I will be purchasing a different brand gaming laptop with a 90 day return policy and 2 year manufacturer's warranty moving forward."," January 14, 2022",1.0

The downside to this laptop is the small 512 SSD which is fine as a boot drive but not for it and storages of games. I was hoping I could use a 2.5 1TB hard drive I have for storage but after getting it open up I found there no drive caddy for the 2.5 so I'm left with getting another SSD for the other M.2 slot. As far as battery life goes I normally have it plug in so I can't say what the battery life will be. The keyboard itself is roomy and comfortable; the keys offer a firm feel with soft-landing switches that result in a satisfying and quiet typing experience. The display image is crisp, bright, and fast and the colors in games and photos look vivid The Nvidia's G-Sync technology matches the screens refresh rate with GPU output for game play without tearing or stuttering.

,"This is a initial reaction review. I received the laptop, cleaned off the bloat-ware and loaded some games.

On the positive side, I like the laptop's sleek feel and appearance and the screen is bright and crisp. I like all of the ports coming out the back, and the cooling fans are not loud enough to even really notice.

The sound was not impressive as I had a hard time even hearing it and compared to the HP Pavilion 16 gaming laptop in the same league, it is quite honestly pathetic.

Secondly, I was disappointed that with specs of this laptop it could not smoothly run Zompiercer in Very High, or even High video quality. I had to lower it to Medium video quality before the 'halting' screen jerking stopped. I honestly thought that it should be able to handle 'HIGH'.

The laptop does run hot when gaming, even when sitting on a cooling base with two very powerful fans, but at least the power supply isn't too hot to touch (the main reason I returned the HP Pavilion 16 PS was 126 degrees and concerned me greatly).

I will run it with some other games, run it with my VR gear, and also give the battery good gaming test, and then update this review accordingly."," September 20, 2021",5.0

,"If you have plans getting this device to install Linux on bare metal for a lightweight, open source and powerful virtualization capable machine this laptop is not the one. After a fresh Linux install, problems encountered out the box include:

• No Bluetooth support
• No WIFI support
• Brightness control buttons do not work

Many laptop manufactures don't spend the time to ensure that their devices work correctly with Linux and this leads to a bad experience. I thought that Lenovo had embraced Linux after hearing some devices would be preinstalled with Fedora however they still have some ways to go. It will take some time before the Linux work flawlessly on this device but until then, you will have to be ready to get your hands dirty compiling and installing the necessary wifi card and graphics card drivers.

For gaming, this is a lower end gaming laptop that will run a lot of games at mid settings. For stuff like League of Legends, you are good to go. Forza Horizon 4? Not at high end settings.

The #1 issue with this laptop is the battery life. This should have been released with a bigger battery. #1 modification for this laptop? The battery upgrade.

You will also need to lug around the power cord/brick with this.

,"7 months ago, there was an issue where the laptop glitched into oblivion. It would not turn on. After contacting Lenovo support, they sent a guy in for onsite repair, and all was fine. However, within a day, a similar but new issue sprang up: The laptop would not turn on, but the fans would be spinning at full blast. A power drain seemed to fix the issue, and everything was fine until mid-late April. Now, whenever the laptop goes to sleep or shuts down, there is a chance that it won't be able to turn back on. Everything will be off, but the fans will be spinning. Each time this occurs, I have to open up the laptop to disconnect the battery from the motherboard just so I can do a power drain. Sometimes this takes 20 seconds, other 90+, and the two times it took over 30 minutes. Support is slow and isn't helpful.

,"I have been a long time Carbon user. Gen 10 is a total miss. Lenovo's standards are completely down the drain now. The Gen 10 Carbon is poorly designed. It suffers from terrible heat and noise issues. They changed the keyboard to be more shallow, it does not feel as good as previous generations at all. And that was a key selling point of ThinkPads. The matte display was mediocre and somewhat more reflective than previous models. The machine has horrible coil whine noise coming from the upper left of the keyboard, just are Gen 9 did. Battery life is pitiful. It is heavier than it should be. The prices are outrageous for what you get. Apple computers blow it out of the water on all fronts.

Los programas se abren rápido y me impresiono que tarda muy poco tiempo en copiar archivos pesados o multiples archivos desde pendrives.
Solo hay unas cuantas cosas que no me gustaron de esta laptop. No es que la RAM esta soldada. No me gusto eso en absoluto pues no se puede aumentar. Otra cosas es que al compararlo con una Lenovo flex 5 con AMD de menor calidad que tengo, la tarjeta gráfica integrada parece no ser tan potente en comparación a la otra. Tambien parece que esta laptop es más propensa a que los programas se cuelguen que la otra. Claro que ese problema parece ser momentáneo. Hasta el momento no me ha pasado que se quede un buen rato colgado o que se reinicie. Aun así, estos detalles me lastiman un poco.
El otro aspecto es el material que, aunque se siente y se ve muy bien, parece mancharse muy fácilmente con la grasa de las manos. Por lo que hay que limpiarlo recurrentemente para que no se acumule.

Excellent Unit for the price point but flimsy build---,"The Lenovo G70-80 is a large laptop. I knew it would be a slow system with the 5400 RPM hard drive.

The hard drive has 4 tiny screws (be careful not to drop them). You will need to remove the two mounting brackets once the hard drive has been removed. Put the brackets and spacer (SSD will have a spacer so it will fit) on the new drive and put it all back together.

,"I ordered this laptop after buying a similar Dell 1 month before. The Dell's power input broke after two weeks due to what I thought was a poorly designed cord. I was looking for something that did not have that defect, since my laptops tend to get some pretty hard usage.
I chose the Lenovo after reading reviews both on Amazon and offsite. My youngest son at college uses a Lenovo and it's held up well in the dorm environment.
Set Up: You go through the usual crap ware during set up, i.e., pleas from Microsoft Office to do their trial, McAfee warnings, mandatory use of Microsoft Edge, etc. Annoying, but you will see that on any laptop. Once you're past that though, the actual Lenovo apps are pretty cool and easy to use.
Day to Day: Easy to use, keyboard is a little undersized for the 17"", but I found that on the Dell too. It's like they have one size keyboard, and just insert it no matter what the size. This leaves a lot of 'dead space' around the keyboard itself, but it is not really a problem, it just looks strange. The actual keyboard is responsive. There is a touchpad that works fine, but no center 'button' to move if you're not a touchpad person. Power input is built and designed very well. Double reinforced and built for long term use. Very impressive. Speed/Boot Speed is fine, it's not the fastest laptop you'll own, but the price is right and it handle programs without any issue, including on-line RPG's/MMO's with little slow down at the high graphic end. Power consumption is a strong point. I play Rift, and have no overheat issues at all, though I did on the similar Dell, and the old HP would shut down after 1/2 hour! Keyboard is not backlit, but again, you're getting a bargain laptop with some decent specs, so the bells and whistles add ons are not there, but aren't really necessary either.
Overall, impressive for the price point."," April 10, 2017",4.0
Big and slow but an easy upgrade.,"This is a decent laptop for the price. Most of my complaints are against Microsoft with their intrusive, in your face Windows 10 operating system; however, this is not Lenovo's fault. One issue I do have is that Lenovo disables the function keys by default. (I suppose they are trying to ""me-too"" what Apple recently did with function keys.) Lenovo provides a buggy Fn key you are supposed to be able to use to re-enable function keys, but it does not work in many situations. For example, to re-enable the function keys, you have to set a BIOS setting. To enter BIOS, you have to use the function keys. The Fn key does not work in this situation. It turns out there is an OKR key on the side of the computer in a small hole near the power input. By using a toothpick, you can enter BIOS if you start with the machine powered off. Aside from this, I have had no problems with the laptop, and it has worked as expected. [This is no longer the case. See the update below.] I especially like the 17 inch screen, which is bigger than most laptops and makes you feel like you have a lot more real estate when working with multiple windows.

UPDATE as of 2017 Jan 31.

The Lenovo Ideapad 300 comes with a flaw in its circuitry. It builds up static electricity, and when the charge gets large enough, things quit working. For many people, the laptop won't boot at all, or the screen won't show anything. For me, the network card quit working. You can try to dissipate the static charge by shutting down the computer, removing the power chord, and then holding the power button for 30 seconds. Sometimes this will fix things. I can't image what poor reasoning went behind Lenovo's decision to sell the this line of computers with such a flaw rather than fixing the design first."," December 29, 2016",4.0
,"This is a very good laptop. It performs very well with 16 gig of memory and the backlit keyboard is a very nice touch. The touch screen is very responsive and easy to use.

,"I got this to sit on my desk 99% of the time with the occasional travel by car. Be warned that it is a heavy beast; this is not the laptop you want to carry through airports or on a daily basis.

My real criticism is the ports. Why could they only find room for 2 USB ports on this monstrous laptop? And only one is USB3. All of the ports are packed together in a tight little group, so if you have just one device with a slightly large connector you have problems.

The power adapter is poorly designed. The power connector is long at the computer end. Most of the computer industry has already figured out that this type of connector on a laptop is prone to damage at its connection to the motherboard. At the plug end (for US 110 volt) the connector seems to have been purposefully designed to make sure it is the only thing that can be plugged into an electrical outlet. I have a powers trip with wide spacing to accommodate ""wall warts"" and this plug still manages to block the adjacent outlets."," April 27, 2017",4.0

Hi Carrie,

My name is Samantha I am in the customer relations department. I am reaching out to you because at this time we cannot repair your machine due to the parts no longer being available. We would like to offer you a refund. Please verify the address you need the check shipped to as a signature is requested upon delivery.

Thank You!

Even though Lenovo's warranty states that they will repair or replace the machine with a machine of equal or better value and the machine died after three weeks, they are only offering a refund. So, unless you have the replacement parts yourself or can make your own, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MACHINE. And, since Lenovo refuses to stand by their warranty, don't purchase another Lenovo Machine either.

Death Notice:

Lenovo IdeaPad 300, died 3/5/2017 at 4:48pm.

It was meant to be a powerful work asset but sadly perished after a brief three-weeks of life. Those three weeks were marvelous, and then IdeaPad started showing signs of deterioration with the final symptom, a round robin of various Lenovo Blue Screens.

The doctors turned to re-formatting discs in hopes of saving the wee bits and bobs without success. The only thing in the room with smiles on it were the Blue Screens, and IdeaPad continued with no ability to boot from disc, get into safe mode, or do anything else.

Time of death called this afternoon. IdeaPad is survived by three desktops and five laptops.

Usually, this paragrah is used to invite you to read more death notices from previous days, but why read more death notices? You can just purchase one of these from this seller or company (they blame one another) and experience it for yourself."," March 6, 2017",5.0

It's fast with plenty of storage and memory. I'm not a gamer so refer to other reviews about that. For working with images and video, it delivers very well.

The machine itself doesn't make too much noise, but you are goin to hear it. So far It doesn't get particularly hot. The battery though, if you play a videogame while unplug it will suck the battery fairly fast, I needed to make some adjustement to make sure it used the minimun ammount of resurces while unplug, so it wouldn't ran dry on me while doing non-videogame related task.

Maybe specify in the description that it is white backlight only.

,"My son needed a new laptop for college, replacing a worn-out HP he'd had for several years. He wanted at least an i7 processor, 1TB SSD and more than 8 or 16 RAM, without spending thousands of dollars. He originally considered two other brands with 64 RAM but reviews were mixed, one had a 17"" screen which he didn't want, and one had negative reviews on seller feedback. Found this Lenovo Legion 5 for a very reasonable price considering it's upgraded with 32 GB, 1 TB SSD and 1 TB HDD. Arrived a day early, he set it up and loves it, especially the speed of the processor and the backlit keyboard. Graphics are good with a full HD screen. Nothing was missing from the box, item was new and so far everything works as it should. Also purchased a 4-year protection plan for peace of mind and total price was still less than comparable laptops. Would definitely buy this again from this seller."," March 10, 2021",5.0

But when you promote over 5 hours and can't deliver even 2, you're just straight out lying. A call to support was short lived. You could tell they were used to this dead end discussion. Suggested I send it back, which I did. Lenovo is a great brand and this is a great device in a mobile format. Only problem is, it isn't mobile.

Very little to no ""bloatware"" as the pro users call unnecessary software apps. This works perfectly for my needs. I am a 67 yr old female with no formal computer training or education.

New Laptop - Good Experience 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"I've had this a little more than a week now and for the most part I'm happy with it. I would probably have given it a 5 star rating, but the few things that are annoying are REALLY annoying for me. As mentioned in other reviews, the right shift key is just in such an awkward spot that it slows me down when typing. And if I don't consciously think about it I just end up moving the cursor to a line up and start typing in the middle of something else. The next one is not as big a deal, but it took me all week to find the ""end"" button because I was looking at the top of the keyboard, but it's on the arrow key under shift. It also doesn't automatically go to the end of the line. Because it is also the right arrow it only moves one space, and when you use control it only moves to the end of the word. But again, awkward position for me and will take some reprogramming of my brain. Other than that, I love the size and weight. I needed something lightweight for school and this fits the bill without breaking the bank. I think I will eventually get used to the keyboard and everything will be just fine. I've never had a 2-in-1 before, and I love the touchscreen ability as well. Super helpful for drawing a diagram in Word. Overall I'm happy with my purchase, if that changes in the future, so will my review."," December 4, 2017",4.0
,"Nice replacement for my Surface Pro 4 which gave out in a little under 18 months; I honestly think I like this more because the keyboard doesn't stain and attract dust molecules and there's no fan that kicks on because I opened up more than 5 chrome tabs (Funnily enough, even without a fan, this computer doesn't get as hot as a Surface). I only wish the keys on the keyboard were a little more clicky/less gel-like, that the backspace key was a little larger, and that the screen wasn't such an oil magnet. The laptop is light, sturdy and has even survived part of a surprise thunderstorm. If and when this laptop passes away (as all laptops eventually do), I'll be looking to Lenovo for another affordable and dependable option.

Good job, Lenovo!"," September 29, 2017",4.0
"Perfect size, but awkward keyboard","I am very happy with this laptop. It's extremely light and slim which was a major necessity for me. Internet browsing is lightening quick which is mainly what I use it for. I've had no issues with the keyboard (as I seen some complaints) other than the missing numeric keypad on the right side which is what i would expect from an 11 inch compact laptop trying to save room... and I do not use the right side shift key (I use the left one) so the misplacement was definitely not an issue. I've typed up long emails with no problems. The laptop comes with a micro HDMI slot so you will need an adapter ($5-10) to plug into your TV with a regular HDMI cable. Also, one USB port is not ideal but there are USB hubs for very cheap that you can buy. Touch screen works great. I haven't tested the battery life yet but will update when I do."," September 17, 2017",4.0

Great little workhorse for anyone on the go,"Laptop is light and powerful. But the screen is very fragile. It fell off my desk when I tripped on the power cord (which unlike some laptops fits very tight into the power port) and the screen cracked in multiple places. This was while I was using it in conventional laptop mode. Now the screen won't turn on and I can only use it with an external monitor.

Again, great deal if you're looking for thin, light and powerful. But just be very careful not to let it fall or you will have yourself a portable desktop computer."," September 4, 2017",4.0
,"The one thing that keeps me from rating this a 5 is the location of the shift key. Lenovo put it right next to the ""PgUp"" key. It is absolutely maddening how the shift key is located next to the PgUp key. I waste more time repositioning the cursor because i accidentally hit the PgUp Key instead of the shift key.

,"Some big perks here- it's small, light, and convertable. The battery life is pretty good, and if you stick it in battery stretch mode (though the lenovo settings app) you can get amazing battery life, around 12 hours or so (processing power slows down but if you're using a word processor on a 10 hour flight it's totally worth it). normal battery life seems to be around 5-8 hrs which is quite fine.
I've gotten used to the keyboard pretty easily- yes the shift key is in a weird place but I'm flexible enough.

When you're using the battery in normal mode, it doessget a little hot. this feels strange as the bottom is plastic, but the top is aluminum and will feel cold in comparison. in battery stretch mode it doesn't feel hot.

What isn't so great- there are a couple of bugs with the tablet mode and screen rotation sensing. Occasionally the computer will randomly think I'm in tent/stand mode (with the keyboard bent around) even though I'm using it like a regular laptop. Then I can't use the keyboard and I have to turn it off and back on. Updating the drivers seems to fix this, although only temporarily. There were other issues as well, like the keyboard still being able to wake the computer when in tablet mode with the keyboard resting on a table.... To get around this I found a fix to disable ymc services (so it only disables the keyboard when it is rotated all the way back). Do a web search to find more info on this. It disables the stand-mode position, but I mostly use this as a regular computer anyway so I don't mind. I'm a little surprised at this software issue since it's a lenovo driver issue specifically. I've had a chromebook convertable that worked perfectly.

Issue 2, power- occasionally I've noticed that it will not go into sleep/hibernate mode when I just close the lid- I'll get home and find the battery has drained. I've gotten in the habbit of hitting the power button on the side first, and then closing the lid, this seems to work around this issue.

issue 3- the single usb port is fine, and the microhdmi port works well (though needing an adapter is very inconvenient). However the usb port and micro hdmi port are right next to each other and I can't use a usb device and an hdmi adapter dongle at the same time. This means I can't use a presentation remote while projecting.

Basically, what you get here is a really nice ultrabook with excellent specs and a few driver issues. If you can sacrifice a full size hdmi port, normal keyboard layout, and are savvy enough to work around the software problems (with the sporadic keyboard/trackpad getting disabled) it's a good machine."," March 19, 2017",3.0
,"Tried out the one at Best Buy but then bought the 6th gen version for my daughter. This laptop is an amazing deal. It's not only cheap but well spec'd and has a high quality build. At this screen size tablet mode may make sense, particularly for a child.

I guess my two main gripes are:
- I wish the cheaper model came with a 256GB SSD drive instead.
- All Lenovo laptops, this one included, have a dysfunctional keyboard design. Specifically, the truncated right shift key. For my daughter it's not a problem because she hardly types but no adult can use this thing, it's really crazy. There's dozens of complaints about it on Best Buy's website and all over the web, with Lenovo scrambling to point out that people can just remap their up key (what you hit instead). But then you lose your up key, also pretty useful. It really boggles my mind how this could happen..."," March 1, 2017",5.0
Keyboard is a mess but amazing laptop otherwise,"Before i bought this , i looked and looked and researched and ordered and tried various different laptops. My requirements were simple
1. should be 11.6 inch FULL HD display (1920 x1080p)
2. Windows laptop with m.2 ssd slot
3. light weight under 2.5 preferably.
4.does not get too hot
5. faster processor intel core i5 or even a core M processor that is fast than atom processors.
6. Backlit key board.
7. should have hdmi support.
8. should be 2 in 1 with touch screen and 360 degree folding
9. under 300$

So i started my search on ebay and amazon for refurbished or pre owned laptops. i first bought thinkpad yoga 11e.
its all good except it has lower resolution display and not the full HD and the model i got had celeron processor making it very laggy. i was considering buying a dell xps 11.6 inch , which had fulL hd , hdmi and faster processor BUT it did not have a real key board , but only a touch screen key board
i couldnt stand , surface pro, the key board looks aweful like so weak

FINALLY thank fully i found this
Lenovo YOGA 710 11ikb , has everything i am looking for ay be except backlit keyboard. But thats fine.
its a small beautiful laptop with 1920x1080 display , micro hdmi, real key board and intel i5 7y54 processor which is super fast. The laptop did get hot like 75c while using it BUT that was before i made some tweaks and reduced the temperature to 36c. I undervolted using throttle stop and reduce the temps to 35c to 40c while browsing. and 50c while playing video. its very cool to use now. I also reduced the processor power from 100% to 90% and undervolted to -90mv on throttle stop, and my laptop cpu performnace is very fast and snappy and stays cool.

I love this laptop. Finally after much research i found the right laptop. i am glad i did not have to setlle for dell xps and was so tired of search results showing 'chromebooks' which i dislike. this is a perfect windows 10 laptop. i have ordered higher capacity ssd for more storage and im loving this i5 7y54 processor which is as good as i7 5600u processor that my other laptop has.
i bought mine preowned on ebay for 289$. This has decent battery life. will get 6 to 7 hours including video watching."," July 14, 2019",5.0

Have to use a wireless keyboard because the keyboard layout has the right ""shift"" button too far out to the right for those people who know how to type. It totally defeats the reason for purchasing the product. Also, It may not be Lenovo's fault, but occasionally the windows start fluttering and moving for no apparent reason.

Shut all that stuff off in the application for mouse but its still a terrible pad. This thing holds a charge for perhaps two hours before dying when the battery icon says 30%. Did I mention the crappy keyboard? Did I mention the flaky wireless connection? No? Well I should have. Don't eve get me into how terrible the stupid touch screen is.

,"Love it! I bought this laptop about 6 months ago and so far I love it! The right shift key is a bit misplaced, but for some strange reason, even though I am a secretary and type 70 wpm, I discovered that I never use the right shift! (I wasn't even aware that I only use the left shift until I saw people were complaining about the right shift key and realized I never used it anyway - guess it's just some strange typing quirk from when I first learned to type, probably because my hands are small). It is fast and super compact. It even runs games fairly well. My only gripe is that there is no sd card slot and you are stuck with only 128 gigs. Not a huge deal, I just carry a thumb drive and keep my videos and pics on that.

I reached out to Amazon, to Lenovo, and then to the third party Tech On Trend as the laptop wasn't loading programs well. I asked for a return. Amazon sent me to Lenovo, and then onto Tech On Trend.

While this was taking weeks, on May 19 my charger sparked and stopped working. Laterally a little fire from the charger. I wrote to Tech On Trend on how I can refund and send back. I spoke on the phone, they said 30 days had passed, I could ship it back for repair. For less than 2 month $1400 laptop, I didn't want a repaired one - I wanted one that would work. I wanted a refund. They said no. I contacted Amazon who reached out and I was given instrudions the end of May on how to return. BUT, I lose 20% for not having original box, and $20% for restocking - so if I send back, I lose 40% of my money.

I now wrote to them to say that I can't lose the $, tell me if they can ship me a new charged or do I send it back for them to fix. NO ANSWER.

What would you do? Lose your money, keep a defective laptop, or pray you can get a charger that will work. I advise against this company

,"Updated review: After a couple of weeks it wouldn't even turn on anymore. Called lenovo and they had us reset it and that did nothing so they sent out a tech (at no cost to us because it is inside of their warranty period). Turns out it was the motherboard that was bad... must have been damaged in shipping. Once the board was replaced it has run flawlessly since.

Original review:
Bought this product (off of lenovo's website) because of its specs as a gift for my girlfriend who just got into nursing school. This review will be from our first impressions and first 3 days of ownership. Its not a pretty picture...

First the positives: Its light weight, fast for common tasks (mostly due to the m.2 drive and 16gb of ram I'd wager), and the 4k screen is very nice for both brightness and quality of image. It can even play games (albeit at 1080p not 4k but if you expect a 2lb laptop with integrated graphics to game at 4k you probably expect politicians to be honest too). At 1080p medium settings, it manages to hold 30-50fps in ""7 days to die"". The pen seems very accurate and handwriting with it and using it as a mouse is simple and intuitive. The sound is way better than you'd expect for such a tiny laptop and the fact that the speaker is in the hinge means it still sounds great in tablet mode too.

As for the drawbacks there are some serious ones. Upon getting the device and getting it set up my girlfriend went to youtube to watch a video and the thing froze up and black screened. When she tried to open task manager or hit esc nothing happened. Power it off and back on and it comes up to a bit locker recovery screen. Cant find the bitlocker key so she calls lenovo. They tell her to use a pin and reset the thing. Nothing. ""Are you sure you put the pin in the right hole? lets try it again."" Reset laptop again. still didnt fix the problem. repeated a 3rd time. still didnt fix it. After an hour on the phone the tech says call microsoft. Girlfriend goes to microsoft's website on her phone, ""all of our technical support is now online please use our website"". Eventually finds the bitlocker key on her own and puts it in. Its a 48 digit code to access her own laptop that she just wanted to reboot because it locked up. This is a terrible idea to enable... ever. Why is it on by default?! I disabled bitlocker and now at least when she has to reboot it that way its just her normal windows pin to get into it. I try using it and it seems to work ok till I go to lenovo's own website and run a scan for problems and it locks up doing that. Go back after restarting and try to scan again to replicate the problem and the scan runs fine. At this point Im thinking its a thermal issue so we put it on her targus laptop cooler from her old laptop. It immediately black screens as soon as we plug it in. Unplug it, restart, plug it back in, black screen again. Get rid of the cooler and just run it on the desk for hours playing 7 days no problem. Go to run netflix app from the start menu, black screen. Reboot, run netflix again, runs for 4 hours straight no problems. At this point I'm thinking its a ram issue but I cant take the ram out because lenovo has so graciously soldiered it to the F'ing motherboard! I could swap the hard drive out but there's no recovery usb included to restore the system should you have to or want to upgrade the drive. I guess if you want any sort of service after your first year you have to pay lenovo because they do not make it easy to fix it yourself.

Conclusion... maybe we got a lemon... maybe its a design flaw. Either way dont buy this laptop unless you just love looking at the windows startup screen."," July 1, 2021",2.0

,"I have no idea how this isn't one of the most popular Chromebooks. The specs on this thing, at $375, is an absolute bargain even for Chromebooks! I was a little worried that it would be slow compared to my last Chromebook (the i5 Pixelbook), but it sure hasn't disappointed so far!

First off, if you're looking at Chromebooks, I'm assuming you've done your research and understand the pros & cons of these devices. If you try to compare this mid-range device to a mid-range Windows laptop then you're comparing apples to oranges. Go back to Google and please do your due diligence so as to better understand the purpose of these laptops. With that said, here's a somewhat brief summary of this beauty.

The Chromebook advertised in the heading was indeed what I received (I was a tad worried as there were varying descriptions of the specs as I perused the page.) For $374.99 I received the Lenovo Flex 5i with an i3 1115G4 processor, 8 GB of LPDDR4 RAM and a 128 GB solid state drive.

The processor, being an 11th gen, is very powerful and is quite sufficient for the vast majority of tasks you'd throw at it using a Chromebook. It certainly exceeds the level of power my Pixelbook's i5 had (granted that was a 7th gen processor). Obviously an i5 or i7 processor will be significantly more powerful, but I believe for most Chromebook users, this specific i3 would more than suffice. Just make sure you're getting the 11th gen i3 and not the 10th gen. If you're not sure how to tell, the first numbers indicate the generation (i.e. a 7th gen i3 would be akin to ""i3-7020"" while a 10th gen i3 would be something like ""i3-10105"").

The 8 GB of DDR4 RAM, at this price, are a God-send. Again, for most users 8 GB (especially since it's DDR4) will be more than adequate to run several apps simultaneously without any significant slowdown or lag. Many of the other Chromebooks I saw at this price point only offer 4 GB and that, in my opinion, is not enough. It's fine if all you plan on doing is some light web browsing, emailing or paper writing. But if you expect to be running multiple apps concurrently and switching back and forth between them, you'll definitely want the 8 GB. And please make sure that RAM is DDR4 or better. Again, many other Chromebooks I saw at this price point were only offering DDR3 RAM.

Next major spec is the solid state drive. 128 GB is more than enough for me and I imagine that would be the case for most people buying a Chromebook in this price range. Many competitors are only offering 64 GB of hard drive; and the worst part of a hard drive that small is that it's likely eMMC (basically a fancy way of saying a flash card, like the ones you use in your camera). They're good if you're working with very small files, but solid state drives (SSD) have superior write speeds so moving files around, as well as file retrieval, will be much faster with an SSD.

The screen is decent in terms of color saturation, brightness, clarity and viewing angle -- nothing special. Assuming you're not expecting to have a high-quality movie experience (which you shouldn't be), then the monitor is fine. Not to mention higher quality monitors mean greater drain on battery life. But where this monitor exceeds my expectations is with regards to its touch screen. The other Chromebook I bought at this price point years ago (the Acer R13) had nowhere near the level of exactitude when it comes to registering input from the stylus. Drawing precise sketches was an exercise in futility and even simple hand writing was a chore. Contrariwise, the Flex 5i registers the smallest movements of my stylus (I'm using the Lenovo USI) without being hypersensitive (registering marks before the stylus makes contact with the screen).

The only negative comment I can make about the Flex 5i is the keyboard. The trackpad is great. And the keys feel decent. But there is a certain hollowness you feel as you strike each key. What I mean is that when I typed on the Pixelbook it not only registered each keystroke with a quiet yet solid ""thud,"" but each keystroke also FELT equally concrete. On the other hand, I believe this keyboard is sitting significantly higher than the hardware beneath it so it makes an audibly ""empty plastic"" sound as you type -- and it feels a little that way too. But in all honesty, that's just nitpicking in my opinion. Again, at just $375 for the quality of specs I received with this computer, I'll very happily take a slightly hollow sounding keystroke as the only negative aspect I've found with this unicorn.

Oh and lastly, I've yet to try out the speakers so I can't comment on those. But I've also never used laptop speakers to watch a movie or listen to music, instead, always opting for headphones. And unlike good old Apple, this computer comes with a standard audio jack as well as Bluetooth for wireless earbuds/headphones.

Overall, I think the Lenovo Flex 5i with the 11th gen i3 processor, 8 GB LPDDR4 RAM and 128 GB SSD is a hidden gem among sub-$400 Chromebooks. The sheer quality of the specs combined with the elegant simplicity of Chrome OS offered at the price of a single month's worth of a Honda lease payment is something I feel extremely lucky to have found."," May 20, 2022",5.0
Fantastic Chromebook; Phenomenal Laptop,"Likes: Lighted keyboard, fast processor for larger spreadsheets, decent resolution, 8 gig ram and
the case is just a tad bigger than my old Acer Spin 311 while having many more pixels to work with. The support date is a long way out. I normally pay $200ish for a Chromebook. I paid $100 more for this, but have no buyers remorse!

Not so good: Dim when viewing movies, etc. Screen scrolling is not too smooth sometimes.
When Chrome needs an update, the laptop runs like it has spyware. Reboot fixes it. It feels a tad heavy at 3.05 lbs, probably because the case is so thin. I would prefer a carbon fiber case vs aluminum if it cost the same. The fan does come on occasionally, especially if I have many tabs open and one has a lot of advertisements running on it. I also turned off the Bluetooth to help save on the battery. It would be nice if the battery lasted longer, but I have many USB 3.0 charger cables now so I can tether to the wall most of the places that I sit with little inconvenience."," May 9, 2023",5.0

,"First of all, I am no one's idea of a ""power user"" or even an experienced Chromebook user. This is only my 2nd Chromebook. I just use it to surf the web for the most part. My previous Chromebook has been a good, reliable, trouble free unit that has served me well for the last six years. That's where I'm coming from.

Due primarily to its' age, the time came to replace my previous Chromebook. (No more updates etc) Research quickly pointed me in the direction of the Lenovo Flex 5i. I didn't want to spend a lot of $$$ just to have a convenient device to surf the web but naturally I did want more speed if I could get it. The Flex 5i delivers!!

8GB of DDR4 ram, I3 Core processor and 128GB of disk space. Web pages load so much faster now. It can update ChromeOS until June '29. The ""cog"" app I use to view CPU/memory load indicates the I3 is easily keeping up with demand. My previous Celeron powered CB would peg the meter consistently.

The Lenovo isn't perfect (what is though?) The cover does show fingerprints. (Cog app indicates this has absolutely no impact on performance though.) The abyss blue color is different, cool and tasteful IMHO. At this point in time though, the fingerprints on the cover are the biggest complaint I have, which should tell you something.

The touchscreen is responsive and accurate. The display is crisp, clear and is more than bright enough to use indoors. The keyboard is wonderful IMHO. The chassis feels solid in my hands. I love the fact that the keyboard is backlit as well. The sound I get out of the speakers is amazing given their size.

I would highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a reasonably priced yet reasonably potent Chromebook . You will get excellent performance and value from the Flex 5i. (Actually I think the Lenovo Flex 5i punches well above its' weight.)"," December 5, 2022",5.0

,"I bought this as a secondary system. I have a desktop and needed something to take around with me for work and school. I have used it for a year and have a lot of good things to say. The features and performance is great for the cost. Chrome OS is an awesome platform if you're willing to play around. It's happy with the 8GB RAM and does not slow down like the cheap Windows laptops. You can also set up Linux and install Android apps on here - so great if you like to mess around with the system and get a tron of features like that.

The screen is pretty It's not very bright, but does the job as long as you're not in an extremely bright environment. It supports USI, so you can use an active stylus. I use Squid for writing notes on and it works well. BUT the palm rejection is app based and can get really annoying when writing at the bottom of the screen, since the system responds to the palm even with the active stylus. This is also great for remotely accessing onto my tower.

Also, it is very cute. But the build could be better. I am already missing a piece of plastic from a corner even with regular use. The screen also flickers once in a while as if it has some loose connections inside.

Overall: Great as a browsing or reading machine, or as a secondary machine for someone who wants a small portable system to complement their desktop."," January 29, 2023",5.0

Best Chromebook,"I got the item that I wanted. Everything looked good, there was even a sheet in there urging me to register my product with Lenovo to activate the warranty. When I went to do that I found that the warranty had already been activated in May. So I guess that this is a refurb and I am not opposed to buying refurbished computers, I've done it in the past, except I paid for a new computer. Nowhere in the description was there any indication that this was refurbished, so that kind of sucks. Am I gonna return it? Probably not, it took 10 days for the computer to get here. I have it now, it works for what I need it to do. I thought the fact that this listing was posted as ""Amazon's Choice"" indicated that was a safe pick, but I'm realizing that was pretty naive.

Lasted 45 minutes before overheating and locking up permanently.,"My Flex 5 chromebook was defective out of the box. It would get extreme hot and shutdown and wouldn't come back on until completely cooled off, which would take several hours. I called the help line and Leveno sent a box and mailing label so that I could send it in for repair. I wrote a two-page note explaining the problem and included the A/C Adapter power cord because it was getting extremely hot during charging. Likewise, I explained in the note why I included the power cord. It went to the North Carolina Repair Center and was there 2 or 3 weeks due to the parts needed to repair it being on order. When I received it back, the A/C Adapter power cord was missing. I called the help line, apparently in some Asian country because the person had such a thick accent I had a hard time understanding what she said, and stated my problem that the power card was missing. She beat around the bush some and when pressed put me on hold after saying she would talk to a supervisor about it. She came back on the line and stated they didn't have any to send me and my best solution would be to go to Best Buy and purchase one. I told her this was unacceptable since the repair center basically stole my power cord. She beat around the bush some more, started hyperventilating and said she would put it on the ""followup list"" and hung up on me. It's been about 2 weeks and I haven't heard anything from them. I ordered another power cord from Amazon and so far so good."," July 6, 2022",2.0

You can get updates and check features even as a guest, which was important to me because this was a gift and I wanted it to be ready out of the box. The blue is a really nice shade of dark cobalt. I chose this because a NYT article from 2023 said it was the best Chromebook and I thought the $350 price was reasonable for 8gb memory. Touchscreen was not too sensitive out of the box, a plus.

I've only been using it a couple days, but so far I have no complaints.

,"Estoy sorprendido de lo rápido que es el procesador y el wifi. Después de más de una semana de uso, puedo dar fe de que todos los sitios que utilizo cargan rápido y sin problemas. Soy profesor y uso aplicaciones de videochat todo el día. Funcionan exactamente como esperaba sin ningún fallo. Todas las extensiones que utilizo también funcionan rápido y sin problemas.

La pantalla no es nada especial. No es más brillante que el MacBook Pro de hace 10 años que tenía y sólo es un poco más nítida. Los blancos no son realmente blancos y los negros son turbios y marrones en el ajuste de brillo más alto. Sorprendentemente, la resolución no es especialmente nítida. Tengo 60 años, así que esto es un problema para mí. De nuevo, mi antiguo MacBook Pro se veía casi igual de bien.

El teclado traquetea un poco cuando escribo, pero no siempre. El teclado se flexiona un poco cuando lo cojo por la esquina. No es posible abrir la tapa con un dedo como ocurre con todos los MacBook que he usado últimamente. Por lo demás, parece de calidad. Es bastante fino y ligero y me gusta el color. El teclado retroiluminado es bienvenido, pero no hay forma de ajustar el brillo.

Las principales limitaciones de este ordenador sólido y de buena relación calidad-precio son las limitaciones de ChromeOS, que no voy a detallar aquí.

En particular, pude instalar Linux y utilizar aplicaciones Linux. Sin embargo, algunas de ellas tuvieron problemas de memoria. Con todas las extensiones que uso en Chrome, el uso de memoria está muy cerca del límite de 8 GB de esta máquina. Añadir Linux y ejecutar GIMP o Inkscape ralentiza todo notablemente. Para un entorno dual-OS pro, realmente es necesario tener más RAM. VLC se congeló cuando lo inicié por primera vez y causó mi primer fallo en todo el sistema.

Ventajas: Buena velocidad para las tareas diarias. Ordenador ligero y bonito.
Contras: Limitado para todo lo que no sean tareas basadas en navegador. Pantalla poco impresionante. No estoy seguro de qué valor añade la pantalla táctil a menos que vayas a usar un lápiz óptico. La reproducción de vídeos es un incordio, probablemente debido a la mala caché."," February 23, 2023",4.0

Great Chromebook for the money!,"I had been limping along with a Dell laptop I bought about 5 years ago and I finally just got fed up with how long it took to boot up, and how quickly it bogged down to snail speed. I never could figure out what was causing the problem. I bought this Lenovo and just spent the last 2 hours using it. Wow, the speed compared to that old Dell is astonishing!
Set up is pretty simple, although I felt Google is trying to gather too much information about me and my activities on this thing, so I noped my way through a lot of the options there.
Love having a full size screen and a numeric keypad; this is the only Chromebook i could find anywhere at this price that had those features. The keyboard is laid out a little differently than on my Dell. For one thing, there is no caps lock key. You'll find a search key where you'd expect the caps lock to be. There are no function keys either, just a row of keys that control some settings, like the volume and brightness, and a lock button. But most everything else is pretty normal.

So far the only thing I don't like is that the power button is on the right outside edge instead of somewhere on the inside where it can't be accidentally turned on when it's closed. I just discovered this issue when I went to move it and my finger bumped the power button. Left handed people may not experience this problem, but since I'm a righty I'll have to be mindful of where I grab it when I pick it up.
I will update if I find problems as I use it but so far I am happy with it. Lenovo, move that power button, please!"," July 24, 2022",5.0

Fantastic Keyboard!!,"The main problem with this system is the keyboard and touchpad. Huge mistake putting the number pad on here. It is tough to type on the tiny space remaning, it is like typing on a 12"" mini-laptop because so much of the keyboard area is taken up by the number pad. The touchpad is very sensitive, so while you're typing on the tiny keyboard, it is constantly re-pointing your cursor in the middle of a sentence. Super annoying.

From a tech standpoint, the graphics are so-so. The processor is very under-powered, I've had similar performance from a 2-core, 6 year old machine. Looking at the system profiler, this machine is very bad at using its resources fully. Even when running multi-threaded machine learning models, this one will almost never push the processors to 100%. It seems like it is capped at 75% most of the time, with a burst of 100% available only for a second or two at a time. This is using code that, on other machines, uses all cores at 100%. So, as a result, it is no better than a crappy $200 years-old machine.

,"The Chromebook came as advertised with the exception that it does not have a backlit keyboard as it was listed as having. It is also completely out of it's warranty period, which was not mentioned. Overall the Chromebook is excellent. It is a little larger and heavier than I expected, but not so much that it is going to be a problem. The picture quality is excellent. As with all Chromebook's the audio quality is good, but the volume is very low. This is compounded by the speakers being on the bottom (do the people who designed this have a different way of holding a laptop where speakers on the bottom is a good listening position?) Downloading any volume boosting extension will solve the volume problem. It has a large keyboard and touch pad, and the touchscreen works well. It charges relatively quickly and the battery seems to last. I have noticed that with 100% battery, when you unplug the charger, there is a noticeable dimming of the screen, which I will have to look into. I've emailed the seller and I am waiting to hear back about the backlit keyboard and warranty. I am withholding 1 star for not having a backlit keyboard 1 for not mentioning it being out of warranty and 1 waiting to see how this is handled. I will update the rating and comments as soon as the dust settles.

Update. I had a response in under 30 minutes. They apologized for the confusion and gave me the options to either return it for a full refund or they would send me $20. I took the $20 which will buy me a keyboard light. Promt, polite and offered a solution acceptable to us both. Great customer service. Changed the rating to 4 stars.
I have a defacto 30 day warranty, in the return window. Lenovo has a 2 year, in home, service in 24 hours warranty I can purchase, that also covers the screen and accidental damage (if I drop it and crack the screen I'm covered) for $122.45 (plus a warranty reinstatement fee if $22). Even with a bogus reinstatement fee its a good deal. The seller, Amazon and Lenovo customer service all did a good job on this one. 2 thumbs up! 👍👍"," May 31, 2022",5.0

,"This laptop is the BEST! I love almost everything about it. Unfortunately, the one thing I wasn't aware of is a major problem for me. The Chrome OS doesn't allow for Adobe products to be installed on it. I use Adobe Illustrator a lot. I bought this expressly for use of graphic design. I read many reviews and did some research before choosing this laptop. If you're not concerned about Adobe products this may be for you. I REALLY wanted this to work for me. I tried several options to get this to work for me, but I was unable to. The reviews I read were all really good. Never would I imagine a laptop wouldn't be able to install an extremely popular platform as Adobe.
If not for that, I would've kept it."," August 17, 2022",5.0
Nice but heavy,"I needed a new Chromebook when my old one's updates expired and it started acting weird. I chose this one because the price, the reviews, the specs, and the expiration date of updates met or exceeded my minimum qualifications.

PROS: I am pleased so far with almost all aspects of the machine. I still have to do a little fine-tuning with the settings but overall, I am pleased.

CONS: 1. Although I was supposed to get a power cord, there was not one in the box. This was not an issue since I could use the one from my old CB.
2. I hate the case. My old CB had a textured plastic case and was very easy to grip and stayed put. I have to tightly grip this smooth metal case when lifting it which creates pain in my hand. It slips around on my lap when I use it. I have to grip the corner. I finally resorted to using a small bathmat upside down to help with the stability.

Bottom line: I like the machine but hate the smooth metal case.

Added note: FYI: This model is supported through June 2025. When the support for my previous Chromebook ended, I planned to continue using it while I shopped for a replacement. However, the device was pretty much unusable after that date - so much garbage, pop-ups, etc. started showing up on my screen. So take that into consideration when buying this model."," October 18, 2021",5.0

Perfect for online school,"This Lenovo is my first Chromebook but umpteenth Lenovo laptop. First, I held my breath and clicked Used - Very Good from Amazon Warehouse Deals to save almost $100. Small cosmetic imperfections on sides of the item. Well, I can't see any imperfections anywhere. Couldn't tell the difference between this and a brand new machine. The laptop looks great, the large screen is awesome, the operation is snappy with the I3, no performance issues with only 4 GB RAM, I am very pleased with this machine, it fully meets my Lenovo build expectations.

One thing that surprised me but shouldn't is that this machine is way heavier than our Lenovo X1 Carbon gen 4. 2.7 lbs vs 4.3 lbs. But, having the larger screen is so great and its a touch screen to boot.

It is Chrome OS that causes the loss of one star. It took me 2 days to configure this machine and I've been building PCs since the late 90's. The problem I had is probably not one that most people will have. I subscribe to G Suite for Business and I guess that when it comes to Chromebooks, the Suite administration sticks its tentacles in there whether you want it or not.

One major issue was that Google Play was disabled in my Chromebook (a nonstarter) with a message that said ""this is managed by your administrator"". I'm the administrator and I did not disable Google Play for any of my devices. Turns out G Suite disables Google Play by default. So just go into G Suite and enable Google Play. Not so fast, navigating G Suite is a nightmare, completely non-intuitive, at least for me. Ultimately after a day of Google searches and fruitlessly trying all kinds of switches in G Suite, a Google support person set me straight. All was fine after speaking with him.

The next challenge was Microsoft Office integration. I also subscribe to Office 365. Eat another day, the MS apps would not let me sign-in with my account. Call to Microsoft support fixed that. Then the next challenge was passing files between OneDrive and Google Drive. Installing File System for Windows was the answer. Finally, I had Chrome OS configured the way I needed it to be. In 2020, it should not be this hard to get your new laptop up and running."," February 7, 2020",4.0

,"This is the first Chromebook I had, I used window desktop and laptop for 15 years. I don't know how the performance compare to others Chromebook, for me is just enough to open about 7 tabs with 1 youtube video playing, in this situation it is slow to move cursor and click the items on page. If you try to playback the 720p60fps or 1080p YouTube, I don't think the processor is good enough to play it as it is lag it you try to do other command, if you try to adjust the video playback speed, it will lag after a few seconds and the video and audio is not synchronized.
If you want to keep the performance just below the limit of this laptop, you can only open 5 tabs on the same time with 1 youtube video 720p or lower quality.
The startup time is 2-3 second, but there will be 2 seconds wait for the chrome load up a page. There will be 5-10second of opening a Google sheet. The Google map is not smooth to use on this laptop, lag to zoom in/out.
For hardware, it is a 1080p mon, 2x usb-c(only 1 can charging), 2x usb-A, 3.5mm mic/headphone, a micro-sd slot. 32GB storage, 11GB for android, 2.5 for chromeOS, 18.5GB rom only.
For me is good enough for light use such as web surface, using Google doc, sheet to do some travel research, the shortcut is also very good, fast to open/close/switch page. But I cannot use it for daily, I only use when I am lazy to turn on the desktop/ not using for a long time/ take it out for discussion.
If you are using a middle range hardware(say i5-4430) computer for a long time, I don't think Lenovo 14e Chromebook can reach your standard of a computer, maybe you can try m3 core or even i3 core Chromebook, it should be fast enough for chrome os as it is a light os compare to window 10. Using this laptop spec for window 10 will be much worst than chrome os. For me, if buying a new Chromebook few years later should buy a i3 core CPU to make sure the performance, as I need is speed and fast enough to open 10 or more tabs and playback 1080p with 2x speed with no lag.
To conclude,
Pro:
light use
maximum 6-7 tabs in the same time is ok
Cheap
Premium outlook
1080p 14"" mon
Can load android apps but slow
Con:
Slow compare to mid range desktop.
Small storage, 18.5GB only
No touch screen"," October 11, 2019",5.0
Just good Chromebook for light use,"The version of ChromeOS it had out of the box was so old that it had a lot of trouble updating itself. It seemed to even have trouble connecting reliably to the wifi. I was worried I would have to update itvwith a usb drive. Once it finally managed to install the first update, it became more stable and happily updated itself several more times until it caught up. After all that it seems fine. I bought it as a Google docs machine and it does that just fine. I have it using an external monitor via a usb-c to displayport cable and that's also working well."," December 1, 2022",5.0

Rough out of box experience but fine after that,"I spent way more time shopping for a cheap laptop than I care to admit. Used, refurbs, outlet deals...I looked everywhere for a halfway decent sub-$300 laptop that ticked all my boxes; lightweight, powerful enough to handle basic tasks (web browsing, emailing, office functions), at least somewhat ""future proof"", and not completely devoid of basic external connection capabilities. Nothing in the Windows OS world really offered everything I needed.

I wound up narrowing my choices down to Chromebooks. This little Chromebook is, so far, perfect for me. It's not prohibitively expensive, but it's also no horribly cheaply made. I've owned a couple of cheap Chromebooks, and while they were plenty functional, they felt like toys. The build quality of this Chromebook is top notch. It's super speedy, boots up in an instant (as most Chromebooks do), and has all the basic functionality I need. The two USB ports are a huge plus, as is the availability of a Bluetooth connection. The screen quality is excellent. The display is bright and vibrant. So much so that I had to turn it down to 60%. Sound quality is lacking, but that's not really relevant, as no one's buying a Chromebook because they need exceptional sound quality. I'm not too fond of the trackpad. I can't quite find a mouse speed setting that moves the cursor just the way I like. It's not a big deal, though. It's more of a personal preference issue, and I use my external Bluetooth mouse most of the time.

As a whole, this Chromebook is a solid 5 star purchase. For the price, it really doesn't get much better than this."," September 11, 2019",5.0

I bought this product in mid August. I haven't been able to get the machine to boot up at all. First time I turned it on, it wouldn't get past the first screen. I spent hours on the phone with Lenovo tech support. They talked me through a factory reset 3 times. That did not help at all.
I had to finally mail it back to Lenovo tech support on October 11. They told me it would be fixed in 7-10 days and they assured me that I would have it back by the 25th. Here we are at the 24th, I called to check progress.

,"I've been a lifelong Windows user and this Chromebook definitely has a learning curve. To be honest I probably won't buy another one simply because it is so different from Windows and is missing a lot of the simple things I took for granted, like being able to see the ink level in my printer cartridges or working on more than one document at a time without continually opening and closing them. That said, for the incredibly low price I paid for it during Prime Days it is quite a good little computer."," September 14, 2022",5.0

,"I wish I returned this but I missed the deadline. What computer doesn't have a DELETE button!!! Seriously. Which means you can't even do ctrl+alt+delete when it freezes on you. And it will. Runs horribly slow as well. Not sure why this one is so different then the one I use at work but it's nothing like it. Oh you have to purchase the Microsoft software separately. Yup it doesn't come with Outlook, Word, Excel, etc. Big waste of money.
Update: Bought in July 2022 and it completely died April 2023. Didn't even get 1 year out of this piece of junk."," October 13, 2022",5.0
Terrible. Don't buy it.,"I purchased this chromebook for my son to use at school. It worked for less than a week, now it will not even power on. It is outside the return window and I am out $160. Purchasing this chrome book was a waste of money."," August 17, 2022",5.0
,"I'm really happy with this at the 179 price point. The amd processor does so much better than the junk Intel in my son's and although the screen could be brighter I just can't complain for the money.

I have 1 little quirk with trying to run tourqe pro but I don't know If it's my adapter or the program wasn't designed for a chromebook, either way not the fault of the machine."," December 6, 2022",5.0

,"Laptop received undamaged and clean; fully function except no trackpoint button present.
This is the red rubber button in the middle of the keyboard that moves the mouse with force rather than motion.

It is easy to buy replacements for this; I got 10 for $10 from TigerDirect.

I resized the Windows partition, and have it set up to dual boot with Debian 11/KDE.

I'm very happy with my purchase. The performance of the NVMe is awesome."," January 29, 2022",5.0
Fully functional with a stock install of Debian 11 Linux. All hardware fully supported.,"In the past few months, I have purchased 4 laptops on Amazon. By far, this is the best one that I have received. The description is accurate - I got a touchscreen with full HD. The machine itself is spotless. I am very pleased with this purchase.

The only disappointment is it DOES NOT have an M.2 PCIe NVMe Opal2 as the description says. It only came with a regular Opal 2 SSD. If it did, then the machine would be a killer. And I can't just upgrade the SSD to an M.2 PCIe NVMe as I don't have the cable required to do so. I will probably put in an updated 2TB SSD.

I might install the internal additional battery if I find it. I might also upgrade the RAM to 32GB to utilize the full capacity of the T470.

All in all, I got a great great great deal."," June 27, 2022",5.0
